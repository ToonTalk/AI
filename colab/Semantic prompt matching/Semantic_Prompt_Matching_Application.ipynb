    "# Semantic Prompt Matching Application\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through the creation of a simple program that matches a new user prompt to the semantically closest pre-defined prompt and returns the associated response. This is useful for building basic chatbots or automated Q&A systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps Involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**: Define a list of pre-defined prompts and their associated responses.\n",
    "2. **Semantic Similarity Calculation**: Implement a method to calculate the semantic similarity between the new prompt and each pre-defined prompt.\n",
    "3. **Finding the Closest Match**: Determine which pre-defined prompt is semantically closest to the new prompt.\n",
    "4. **Returning the Response**: Return the response associated with the closest pre-defined prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n"
