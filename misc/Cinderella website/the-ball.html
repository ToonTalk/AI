      <h2>The Fairy Godmother</h2>
      <div class="section-divider"></div>
      <p>I had not been permitted to attend the ball. My stepmother presented my stepsisters in their finest gowns and left me alone in the kitchen, weeping beside the cold hearth.</p>
      <p>Then — a shimmer in the air. A figure, small and warm and utterly impossible, appeared before me. She called herself my fairy godmother, and she spoke as if we had always known each other.</p>
      <p>"Dry your tears, my dear. You shall go to the ball."</p>
      <div class="pull-quote">
        "She waved her wand and the pumpkin became the most magnificent carriage I have ever seen — pearl-white, gilded in gold."
      </div>
      <p>The mice became horses. The lizards became footmen. My rags became a gown of midnight blue silk, threaded through with silver, as though someone had sewn a piece of the sky.</p>

      <div class="section-divider"></div>
      <p>The carriage swept through the palace gates. The footmen handed me down as though I were genuine royalty — and in that moment, I felt as though I truly was.</p>
      <p>Every head on the grand staircase turned. Candlelight caught the silver thread in my gown and threw tiny stars across the ceiling. I had to remind myself to breathe.</p>
      <div class="pull-quote">
        "At the top of the stairs, a young man in deep blue stood apart from the crowd — and he was looking only at me."
      </div>
      <p>The herald announced no name for me — I had not given one — but the prince descended the stairs without a moment's hesitation and offered his hand.</p>

      <h2>The Dance</h2>
      <div class="section-divider"></div>
      <p>I do not know how long we danced. Time seemed to pool and slow. The orchestra played waltzes that felt written for us alone, and the crowd fell back to watch.</p>
      <p>He asked my name. I told him only Ella. He said that was the most beautiful name he had ever heard, and I laughed — truly laughed — for the first time in years.</p>
      <p>We talked between dances on the moonlit balcony. He spoke of loneliness inside a palace full of people. I understood that better than he could have imagined.</p>

        "For a few hours, standing beside him, I forgot entirely that I did not belong."
