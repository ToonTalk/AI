While it produced a nearly perfect solution, a subtle bug emerged where it reversed digit triples. Interestingly, when prompted to fix this specific bug, the model became confused, even generating Python instead of JavaScript, likely due to an overloaded context.

Early experiments included developing a machine learning-powered Q&A program and an unsuccessful turtle geometry interpolator. A custom \"Colab Notebook Creator\" GPT was then built, designed to generate structured notebooks with alternating explanatory text and code, offer Colab instructions, and adapt to user skill levels. However, subsequent attempts to leverage this custom GPT for tasks like a paraphrase generator or a Python-to-JavaScript translator largely proved unsuccessful, highlighting significant challenges in AI-driven notebook automation, despite some later promise shown by Gemini Advanced."}, {"title": "A pure spoken interaction with ChatGPT 3.5", "post_url": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pJy3RfKmzHyFEuEp7mkmqFnvpYGs3VGjhHTPXYcnU5k/edit?usp=sharing", "apps": [], "chat_logs": [{"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/c12d0e45-c296-403d-9b6b-2daa615125cb", "title": "ChatGPT - City distance"}, {"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/c12d0e45-c296-403d-9b6b-2daa615125cb", "title": "ChatGPT - City distance"}], "videos": [], "chatbots": ["ChatGPT"], "description": "This research details a unique, purely spoken interaction with ChatGPT 3.5 to develop a functional web application.
