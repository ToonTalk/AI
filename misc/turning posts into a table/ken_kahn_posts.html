Using Claude Sonnet 4.5, Kahn explored recreating and enhancing this concept, bringing the computational evolution of intelligent game-playing agents into the modern era. The result is a compelling journey, potentially manifesting in the \"Cosmic Trader - Space Property Game,\" demonstrating AI's power to reanimate and advance classic computational experiments."}, {"title": "Struggles to get ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to make a calculator with exact fractions and very large integers", "post_url": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q0PdS9aqgzfVFJc_nYfh8eAYqPPlAagd6qJatjhK0bM/edit?usp=sharing", "apps": [{"url": "https://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/super-calculator-by-o1-mini.html", "title": "Advanced Calculator"}, {"url": "https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/b6a6d4e3-dff7-4b2b-9634-16c0e4438190", "title": "Claude Artifact"}, {"url": "https://chatgpt.com/canvas/shared/68e5193739648191b2dd8f33ca049c77", "title": "ChatGPT - Exact Fractions Calculator \u2014 Restored (fixed)"}, {"url": "https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/5e5d4fee-d3f5-42d5-aff9-67636f520905", "title": "Claude Artifact"}, {"url": "https://g.co/gemini/share/9159060246c3", "title": "Gemini"}, {"url": "https://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/super-calculator-by-o1-mini.html", "title": "Advanced Calculator"}, {"url": "https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/b6a6d4e3-dff7-4b2b-9634-16c0e4438190", "title": "Claude Artifact"}, {"url": "https://chatgpt.com/canvas/shared/68e5193739648191b2dd8f33ca049c77", "title": "ChatGPT - Exact Fractions Calculator \u2014 Restored (fixed)"}, {"url": "https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/5e5d4fee-d3f5-42d5-aff9-67636f520905", "title": "Claude Artifact"}], "chat_logs": [{"url": "https://chatgpt.com/share/6718b690-9cdc-800e-9bef-d155dbc11937", "title": "ChatGPT - Web Calculator with Fractions"}, {"url": "https://claude.ai/share/5df70926-b821-4ffb-b920-4b82e01ec52a", "title": "Claude Chat"}, {"url": "https://chatgpt.com/share/68e3e9c5-7a64-800e-b4eb-8b04ec3457de", "title": "ChatGPT - Web-based fraction calculator"}, {"url": "https://claude.ai/share/dcc1dd3d-c979-4673-9f74-59e851c37432", "title": "Claude Chat"}, {"url": "https://g.co/gemini/share/c27b7bb80a33", "title": "Gemini"}, {"url": "https://chatgpt.com/share/6718b690-9cdc-800e-9bef-d155dbc11937", "title": "ChatGPT - Web Calculator with Fractions"}, {"url": "https://claude.ai/share/5df70926-b821-4ffb-b920-4b82e01ec52a", "title": "Claude Chat"}, {"url": "https://chatgpt.com/share/68e3e9c5-7a64-800e-b4eb-8b04ec3457de", "title": "ChatGPT - Web-based fraction calculator"}, {"url": "https://claude.ai/share/dcc1dd3d-c979-4673-9f74-59e851c37432", "title": "Claude Chat"}, {"url": "https://g.co/gemini/share/9159060246c3", "title": "Gemini"}, {"url": "https://g.co/gemini/share/c27b7bb80a33", "title": "Gemini"}], "videos": [], "chatbots": ["ChatGPT", "Claude", "Gemini"], "description": "This research details the surprising struggles encountered when prompting ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to build a sophisticated web-based calculator.

This experiment vividly illustrates both the immense potential of AI-driven 3D generation and the current, often amusing, limitations in translating complex instructions into accurate virtual environments."}, {"title": "Can ChatGPT 4 help me discover whether weather data can predict influenza cases?", "post_url": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bqivgaL11k1ospBRxuO42EMo2YlihsVeJ9tWhyuJZeE/edit?usp=sharing", "apps": [{"url": "http://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/weather%20and%20flu/merge%20datasets.html", "title": "Weather-Influenza Correlation App"}, {"url": "https://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/weather%20and%20flu/chicago_weather.csv", "title": "ToonTalk App"}, {"url": "https://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/weather%20and%20flu/Illinois%20flu.csv", "title": "ToonTalk App"}, {"url": "http://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/weather%20and%20flu/predict%20evaluate%20total%20patients.html", "title": "Weather-Influenza Prediction App"}, {"url": "http://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/weather%20and%20flu/Illinois_merged_data.csv", "title": "ToonTalk App"}, {"url": "http://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/weather%20and%20flu/predict%20evaluate.html", "title": "Weather-Influenza Prediction App"}, {"url": "http://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/weather%20and%20flu/Illinois_merged_data%202010-Sept%202019%20ratio%20updated.csv", "title": "ToonTalk App"}, {"url": "http://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/weather%20and%20flu/merge%20datasets.html", "title": "Weather-Influenza Correlation App"}, {"url": "https://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/weather%20and%20flu/chicago_weather.csv", "title": "ToonTalk App"}, {"url": "https://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/weather%20and%20flu/Illinois%20flu.csv", "title": "ToonTalk App"}, {"url": "http://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/weather%20and%20flu/predict%20evaluate%20total%20patients.html", "title": "Weather-Influenza Prediction App"}, {"url": "http://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/weather%20and%20flu/Illinois_merged_data.csv", "title": "ToonTalk App"}, {"url": "http://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/weather%20and%20flu/predict%20evaluate.html", "title": "Weather-Influenza Prediction App"}, {"url": "http://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/weather%20and%20flu/Illinois_merged_data%202010-Sept%202019%20ratio%20updated.csv", "title": "ToonTalk App"}], "chat_logs": [{"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/e5e47e8d-f8c9-4c33-9edc-82f16bec41da", "title": "ChatGPT - Influenza Prediction with TensorFlow"}, {"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/25a84fa3-8cb1-4794-a532-a43c6e2e8878", "title": "ChatGPT - Convert to Weekly Dataset"}, {"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/40d5440f-69f4-4c65-8386-e616584d336f", "title": "ChatGPT - Flu Predictor with TensorFlow.js"}, {"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/25a84fa3-8cb1-4794-a532-a43c6e2e8878", "title": "ChatGPT - Convert to Weekly Dataset"}, {"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/e5e47e8d-f8c9-4c33-9edc-82f16bec41da", "title": "ChatGPT - Influenza Prediction with TensorFlow"}, {"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/25a84fa3-8cb1-4794-a532-a43c6e2e8878", "title": "ChatGPT - Convert to Weekly Dataset"}, {"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/dd6a96c5-6072-451b-a7c9-50fd4ecb1f41", "title": "ChatGPT - Analyze Illinois weather & patients."}, {"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/8e6b50c2-413a-4363-9802-5868ba6f0771", "title": "ChatGPT - COVID-19 Spike Analysis"}, {"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/e5e47e8d-f8c9-4c33-9edc-82f16bec41da", "title": "ChatGPT - Influenza Prediction with TensorFlow"}, {"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/25a84fa3-8cb1-4794-a532-a43c6e2e8878", "title": "ChatGPT - Convert to Weekly Dataset"}, {"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/40d5440f-69f4-4c65-8386-e616584d336f", "title": "ChatGPT - Flu Predictor with TensorFlow.js"}, {"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/25a84fa3-8cb1-4794-a532-a43c6e2e8878", "title": "ChatGPT - Convert to Weekly Dataset"}, {"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/e5e47e8d-f8c9-4c33-9edc-82f16bec41da", "title": "ChatGPT - Influenza Prediction with TensorFlow"}, {"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/25a84fa3-8cb1-4794-a532-a43c6e2e8878", "title": "ChatGPT - Convert to Weekly Dataset"}, {"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/dd6a96c5-6072-451b-a7c9-50fd4ecb1f41", "title": "ChatGPT - Analyze Illinois weather & patients."}, {"url": "https://chat.openai.com/share/8e6b50c2-413a-4363-9802-5868ba6f0771", "title": "ChatGPT - COVID-19 Spike Analysis"}], "videos": [], "chatbots": ["ChatGPT"], "description": "This research explores the intriguing question of whether weather patterns can predict influenza cases, leveraging ChatGPT 4 as an indispensable AI co-pilot.

The project features a fascinating portfolio of apps built this way, including a \"Random Integer Speaker,\" a \"Finger Drawing\" tool, a \"Confidence Predictor,\" and a \"Virtual Persona Chat.\" Beyond these, the exploration extends to generating illustrations, complex calculators, and even ecological simulations, demonstrating the LLM's remarkable versatility. By framing programming as a conversational process, the work offers an interactive way to understand how AI can empower individuals to build functional tools, while also comparing the capabilities of various LLMs."}, {"title": "A list of the apps and conversations", "post_url": "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cfRh__IrStR2cszcbG_otphx1MQiu4-b5afhpKd4A48/edit?usp=sharing", "apps": [{"url":
