    <h1>Weather-Influenza Correlation App</h1>

    <p>This application explores the potential correlation between weather patterns and the occurrence of influenza in the state of Illinois, with a particular focus on the Chicago metropolitan area. By analyzing historical weather data and influenza occurrence data, we aim to understand whether the weather in a given week might affect the incidence of influenza in the subsequent weeks.</p>

    <p>The weather data is stored in a file called 'chicago_weather_weekly.csv', which contains weekly summaries of various weather parameters in the Chicago area. The influenza data is stored in a file called 'illinois_flu.csv', which contains weekly reports of influenza cases in Illinois.</p>

    <p>This application uses TensorFlow.js to create, train, and evaluate predictive models based on these datasets. The ultimate goal is to understand whether weather parameters can be used as predictive factors for influenza outbreaks.</p>

    <p>Please note: this application processes large datasets and performs complex calculations, which may take some time. Thank you for your patience.</p>
