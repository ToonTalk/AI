        <h2>Explanation</h2>
        <p>Cantor's diagonalization argument is a proof technique used to show that some infinite sets are "larger" than others. In this case, it demonstrates that the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 is uncountable.</p>
        <p>The proof works as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Assume we have a list of all real numbers between 0 and 1.</li>
            <li>We create a new number by changing each digit along the diagonal of our list.</li>
            <li>This new number differs from every number on our list in at least one digit.</li>
            <li>Therefore, this new number cannot be on our original list.</li>
            <li>This contradicts our assumption that we had listed all real numbers between 0 and 1.</li>
            <li>We conclude that it's impossible to list all real numbers between 0 and 1, proving that this set is uncountable.</li>
        </ol>
