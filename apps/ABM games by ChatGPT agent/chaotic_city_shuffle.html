        <h2>About Chaotic City Shuffle</h2>
        <p>In a bustling city, commuters follow simple rules to get to work: stay in your lane, keep a safe distance, and move forward. In this simulation the cars are represented by coloured rectangles travelling across horizontal lanes. By clicking on the canvas you place obstacles on the roadway, forcing cars to slow down or switch lanes. There is no winning or losing hereâ€”just watch how seemingly minor changes can cascade into traffic jams or unexpected flow patterns.</p>
        <p>To play: click within a lane to drop a purple roadblock. Cars will attempt to switch to a clear lane when they encounter a block. Observe how a single misplaced cone can disrupt an entire lane.</p>
