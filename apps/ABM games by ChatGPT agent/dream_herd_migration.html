        <h2>About Dream Herd Migration</h2>
        <p>Every autumn, herds undertake long migrations guided by instinct and memory. In this whimsical simulation you influence that guidance system by planting &ldquo;dream cues&rdquo;â€”ethereal signposts that subtly steer the herd. Each cue exerts a pull on nearby animals, altering their internal compass.</p>
        <p>The animals begin on the left of the canvas and naturally drift to the right. Click anywhere to add a dream cue. Animals within its radius will gradually turn toward it. Use multiple cues to sculpt their route and help them avoid obstacles. There is no single goal; enjoy watching the flowing patterns as hundreds of tiny decisions combine into a collective movement.</p>
