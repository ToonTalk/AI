        <h2>About Belief Cascade</h2>
        <p>This simulation models how ideas spread through a social network. Each node represents an individual with a belief value between 0 (sceptical) and 1 (believing). At each moment, individuals adjust their belief toward the average of their neighbours.</p>
        <p>You can influence the network by dropping fact or rumour bombs. A fact bomb pushes nearby individuals toward scepticism (blue), while a rumour bomb pushes them toward belief (red). Over time, the network may converge on a consensus or polarise into echo chambers. Experiment with bomb placement and observe the cascading effects.</p>
        <p>On most browsers you can right‑click to place a rumour bomb. If your browser opens a context menu, you may need to hold Ctrl while clicking.</p>
