        <h2>About Nanobot Maze Escape</h2>
        <p>Nanobots can’t think, but they can follow rules. In this simulation a swarm of tiny bots navigates a maze using a simple strategy: keep one hand on the wall at all times. You can switch between the right‑hand and left‑hand rules with the toggle button. Observe how the chosen rule affects their path through the same maze.</p>
        <p>The maze is generated at page load. Bots spawn at the upper left and aim for the lower right corner. They leave faint trails behind them so you can see their progress. There is no need for you to control the bots directly—just choose the rule and watch them explore.</p>
