        <h2>About Pollinator Predator Garden</h2>
        <p>Plant flowers by clicking on the garden. Bees wander the meadow in search of blossoms. They prefer nectar‑rich flowers and each visit consumes nectar, which gradually regenerates. With enough pollination, new blooms may appear nearby.</p>
        <p>Spiders roam the garden hunting bees. If a spider catches a bee, the bee is removed (but will respawn elsewhere). Keep enough flowers growing so there’s plenty of nectar to attract bees without letting predators wipe them out. Enjoy watching the dynamic interactions unfold.</p>
        <p><strong>New in Version&nbsp;02:</strong> Bees now care about nectar! They prefer nectar‑rich flowers and consume nectar during each visit, causing blossoms to regrow their nectar over time.</p>
