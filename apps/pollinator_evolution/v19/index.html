        <h2>About Pollinator Predator Garden</h2>
        <p>Plant flowers by clicking on the garden. Bees roam in search of nectar‑rich blossoms, remember their last flower and avoid returning too soon. Bees prefer flowers rich in nectar, consume nectar that regenerates quickly, leave faint pollen trails, and occasionally return to their hive to rest and spawn new bees. Flowers come in two distinct types with different colours and nectar regeneration rates, and each bloom has its own nectar rate and colour inherited by offspring with slight mutations. Flowers with high pollination counts may cause new blooms to appear nearby.</p>
        <p>Rain showers periodically sweep across the garden, slowing all agents and boosting nectar regeneration. Bees rest at night while spiders become more active. Spiders roam, spin webs that can trap bees, and birds hunt spiders to keep their numbers in check. Balance the number of flowers so there's enough nectar without letting predators wipe out the bees.</p>
        <p><strong>New in Version&nbsp;19:</strong> An ecosystem balance meter now tracks the numbers of bees, spiders, birds, and flowers in real time. The overlay shows you whether the system is in balance. Keep an eye on the meter to see how your interventions—planting flowers, freezing spiders and more—affect the overall health of the garden.</p>
