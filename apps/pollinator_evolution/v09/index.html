        <h2>About Pollinator Predator Garden</h2>
        <p>Plant flowers by clicking on the garden. Bees roam the meadow in search of nectar‑rich blossoms; they remember the last flower they visited and avoid returning too soon. Bees prefer flowers rich in nectar, consume nectar that regenerates faster in this version, leave faint pollen trails, and occasionally return to their hive to rest and spawn new bees. Flowers come in two distinct types with different colours and nectar regeneration rates. Flowers with high pollination counts may cause new blooms to appear nearby.</p>
        <p>A day/night cycle means bees sleep at night while spiders become more active. Spiders roam the garden looking for bees. Balance the number of flowers so there's enough nectar without letting predators decimate the bee population.</p>
        <p><strong>New in Version&nbsp;09:</strong> Spiders have learned to spin webs. These webs can temporarily trap bees, causing them to respawn elsewhere. This adds a new layer of strategy to maintaining the pollinator‑predator balance.</p>
