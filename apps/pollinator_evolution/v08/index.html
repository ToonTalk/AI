        <h2>About Pollinator Predator Garden</h2>
        <p>Plant flowers by clicking on the garden. Bees roam in search of nectar‑rich blossoms; they remember the last flower they visited and avoid returning too soon. Bees prefer flowers rich in nectar, consume nectar that regenerates quickly, and occasionally return to their hive to rest and spawn new bees. Bees rest at night while spiders become more active. Flowers come in two distinct types with different colours and nectar regeneration rates, and flowers with high pollination counts may cause new blooms to appear nearby.</p>
        <p>Spiders roam the garden hunting bees. Keep enough flowers growing so there’s plenty of nectar to attract bees without letting predators wipe them out.</p>
        <p><strong>New in Version&nbsp;08:</strong> Bees now leave faint pollen trails behind as they travel. These trails slowly fade, revealing foraging paths and adding a new dimension to the garden’s visual complexity.</p>
