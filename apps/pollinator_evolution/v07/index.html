        <h2>About Pollinator Predator Garden</h2>
        <p>Plant flowers by clicking on the garden. Bees roam in search of nectar‑rich blossoms; they remember the last flower they visited and avoid returning too soon. Bees prefer flowers rich in nectar, consume nectar that regenerates quickly, and occasionally return to their hive to rest and spawn new bees. Bees rest at night while spiders become more active. Flowers with high pollination counts may cause new blooms to appear nearby.</p>
        <p>Spiders roam the garden hunting bees. Keep enough flowers growing so there’s plenty of nectar to attract bees without letting predators wipe them out.</p>
        <p><strong>New in Version&nbsp;07:</strong> Two flower types have been introduced. Blossoms now come in distinct colours with different nectar regeneration rates, influencing bee foraging and garden dynamics.</p>
