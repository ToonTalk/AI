        <h2>About Pollinator Predator Garden</h2>
        <p>Plant flowers by clicking on the garden. Bees roam in search of nectarâ€‘rich blossoms, remember their last flower and avoid returning too soon. Bees prefer flowers rich in nectar, consume nectar that regenerates quickly, leave faint pollen trails, and occasionally return to their hive to rest and spawn new bees. Flowers come in two distinct types with different colours and nectar regeneration rates, and each bloom has its own nectar rate and colour inherited by offspring with slight mutations. Flowers with high pollination counts may cause new blooms to appear nearby.</p>
        <p>Rain showers periodically sweep across the garden, slowing all agents and boosting nectar regeneration. Bees rest at night while spiders become more active. Spiders roam, spin webs that can trap bees, and birds hunt spiders to keep their numbers in check. Balance the number of flowers so there's enough nectar without letting predators wipe out the bees.</p>
        <p><strong>New in Version&nbsp;20:</strong> An emergent goal has been added! To succeed, maintain a stable ecosystem: keep bee, flower, spider, and bird populations within healthy ranges for an extended period. When you achieve a balanced ecosystem, a congratulatory message will appear. See how long you can keep the garden thriving!</p>
