        <h2>About Pollinator Predator Garden</h2>
        <p>Plant flowers by clicking on the garden. Bees roam in search of nectar‑rich blossoms; they remember their last flower and avoid returning too soon. Bees prefer nectar‑rich flowers, consume nectar that regenerates quickly, leave faint pollen trails, and occasionally return to their hive to rest and spawn new bees. Flowers come in diverse colours and sizes with traits inherited by offspring, and zones of fertile, dry and toxic ground influence growth and movement.</p>
        <p>Rain showers periodically sweep across the garden, slowing agents and boosting nectar regeneration. Bees rest at night while spiders become more active. Spiders roam, spin webs that can trap bees, and birds hunt spiders to keep their numbers in check. Use powers (F = freeze spiders, P = fertilise flowers, B = scatter bees) and the view toggle (V) to explore the ecosystem.</p>
        <p><strong>New in Version 21:</strong> This version introduces numerous balancing improvements: predator–prey dynamics are refined to prevent extinctions; flower and bee populations have caps tied to available resources; a progress bar tracks your progress toward a balanced ecosystem; a legend shows the meaning of each zone; a Restart button lets you reset the simulation; trail density is limited; controls are summarised on screen; and a simple graph plots population trends over time.</p>
        <p><strong>Additional enhancements in this improved build:</strong> Pause and resume the simulation with the spacebar, adjust the simulation speed using <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>, toggle zone backgrounds with <code>Z</code>, toggle trails with <code>T</code>, trigger a rain shower with <code>W</code>, plant clusters of flowers by holding <em>Shift</em> while clicking, remove a flower by right‑clicking it, and see webs and speed information in the overlay.</p>
