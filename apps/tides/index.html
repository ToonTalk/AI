            <h2>What are Tides?</h2>
            <p>Tides are the regular rise and fall of the ocean's surface caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun, along with the rotation of the Earth.</p>

            <h2>Gravitational Forces</h2>
            <div id="gravity-animation">

            </div>
            <p>The moon's gravity pulls on the Earth's oceans, creating bulges of water on the side closest to the moon and the side farthest from the moon. This causes high tides. The sun's gravity also affects tides, making them higher or lower depending on the alignment of the sun, moon, and Earth.</p>

            </div>
            <p>High Tide: When the water level is at its highest.<br>
               Low Tide: When the water level is at its lowest.<br>
               Spring Tide: Occurs when the sun, moon, and Earth are aligned, causing very high high tides and very low low tides.<br>
               Neap Tide: Occurs when the sun and moon are at right angles to each other, causing less extreme tides.</p>

            <h2>Tidal Cycles</h2>

            </div>
            <p>Most coastal areas experience two high tides and two low tides within a 24-hour period. This cycle is influenced by the positions of the moon and the sun relative to the Earth.</p>
