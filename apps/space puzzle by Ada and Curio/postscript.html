    <p>The rest of the conversation did not go well.
        I suggested "let's get rid of solve puzzle button but if you get it right a new puzzle appears" and a long series of syntax errors occurred.
        I asked if it would help to upload the current HTML file and Ada and Curio said it would help. But then it kept getting errors.</p>

    <p>I almost never see syntax errors and my guess is that the data URL for the image is making it hard for ChatGPT to see and fix the code it authored. The image takes up almost half a megabyte.</p>
