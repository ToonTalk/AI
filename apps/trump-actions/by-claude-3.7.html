Hundreds of Venezuelan migrants were whisked to an overseas detention site under this wartime authority before courts intervened.

The administration praised a controversial Texas law that gives partisan poll watchers more power and criminalizes small voting errors. The year 2000, notably marked by the Florida recount drama, spurred many to call for more voting access (like better machines, early voting). To see, in 2025, a President applauding and enabling laws that make voting harder ‚Äì disproportionately affecting minority voters ‚Äì would be quite surprising. It's a 180-degree turn from the post-2000 mindset that every vote should count and barriers should be lowered.",

  content: "Perhaps most bewildering to a 2000 observer, President Trump in 2025 still insists that the 2020 election was stolen from him, despite no evidence and the passage of time. He frequently calls the 2020 result 'rigged' and refers to his predecessor as an illegitimate president. This 'Big Lie' has become a central tenet of his rhetoric. In 2000, the country went through a bitter recount, but once the Supreme Court decided Bush v. Gore, Vice President Gore conceded and legitimacy was accepted. The norm was that, however contentious an election, once decided, all parties respected the outcome. The idea of a sitting U.S. president continually undermining a past election's legitimacy ‚Äì even as he's now in office again ‚Äì would be truly shocking and corrosive to the faith in democracy that Americans in 2000 largely shared.",

In 2000, impeachment was regarded as a grave constitutional process (recall the solemnity around Clinton's impeachment in 1998). The notion of a majority simply retroactively canceling an impeachment because the president's party now has power would be astonishing.

In 2000 ‚Äì when the U.S. was generally seen as the leading supporter of fledgling democracies ‚Äì the idea that an American president would side with a Russian authoritarian's narrative over a small democratic nation's fight for survival would be shocking.

In a high-profile February phone call, Trump agreed with Putin to halt certain Ukrainian operations and called Ukraine's hopes of reclaiming occupied territory 'illusionary'.

With that single call, Trump ended the U.S. policy of isolating Putin for the invasion, treating him instead as a negotiating partner. Russian officials openly rejoiced that Trump 'ditched 3 years of U.S. policy on Ukraine'. To observers in 2000, this would be baffling: they would remember Putin as a new leader watched warily by the U.S., and NATO's commitment to defend new democracies in Eastern Europe. A U.S. president giving Putin what he wants ‚Äì and doing so proudly, while throwing a democratic ally under the bus ‚Äì is the opposite of what they'd expect.

He also ordered the Pentagon to plan for withdrawing roughly 20,000 U.S. troops from Europe unless allies pay more. In 2000, NATO was at its post-Cold War zenith, expanding and united; the U.S. president unequivocally backed Article 5 (which had never been questioned).

For example, within months of a U.S. pullout from eastern Syria, Russian and Turkish forces filled the void and Kurdish allies felt betrayed.
