    "details": "National Parks and Drilling: The Trump administration opened previously protected lands to development. For example, it green-lit drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a pristine wilderness that had been off-limits for decades. It also removed protections from vast areas of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah, allowing mining claims on lands rich in Native American history. In 2000, national parks and monuments were almost sacred – the idea of shrinking a monument by 85% to allow private extraction would have caused a national outcry (indeed, no president had attempted such a rollback in modern times).

Whether on climate (where at COP summits, the U.S. delegation is now the skunk at the garden party defending coal) or at the U.N.

It would seem as if the U.S. no longer aspires to be the “shining city on a hill,” but rather an obstinate superpower uninterested in solving global problems, which would deeply surprise those from an era when U.S. global leadership was taken for granted.",
