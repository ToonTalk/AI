Trump said he'd get rid of certain FBI agents 'very surgically'. Indeed, lists of agents and lawyers to be dismissed were drawn up. This level of politicization – targeting individuals in law enforcement for doing their jobs – would shock a 2000 observer. Back then, even during heated moments like the Elian Gonzalez case or Clinton's impeachment, there was no mass purge of FBI agents or prosecutors based on whom they investigated. The norm was that justice should be blind and above politics.",

He also mused about pardoning individuals like a police officer convicted of murder (saying 'maybe he was treated unfairly'). In 2000, such interventions in the military justice system or criminal justice – against the recommendations of the Pentagon and DOJ – would be met with bipartisan outrage.

Moreover, Trump's HHS sided with states like South Carolina seeking to defund Planned Parenthood by excluding it from Medicaid. In 2000, the idea of banning an FDA-approved medication that's been safely used for years (because of politics) and the federal government actively working to undermine reproductive rights nationwide – even in medical emergencies – would have been extremely surprising.

This upends decades of U.S. policy aimed at preventing nuclear proliferation. In 2000, the U.S. was working to reduce nukes (through treaties) and keep allies under the U.S. nuclear umbrella precisely so they wouldn't need their own bombs. Trump's suggestion that allies fend for themselves with nukes would deeply shock someone from that era, bringing to mind the destabilizing nuclear arms races the world had tried to avoid since the Cuban Missile Crisis.",

  summary: "Trump followed through on plans to withdraw nearly all remaining U.S. troops from conflict zones like Afghanistan and the Middle East, even if conditions were shaky.",
  content: "Trump followed through on plans to withdraw nearly all remaining U.S. troops from conflict zones like Afghanistan and the Middle East, even if conditions were shaky. (Notably, he accelerated a drawdown in Iraq and Syria, leaving a minimal presence that critics say allowed ISIS remnants and other militias to regroup.) While ending 'forever wars' is popular, doing so without coordination or care for the aftermath (as many observed) has led to chaos and power vacuums. For example, within months of a U.S. pullout from eastern Syria, Russian and Turkish forces filled the void and Kurdish allies felt betrayed. In 2000, the U.S. was engaged in peacekeeping in the Balkans and seen as a stabilizing force; fast withdrawal without planning would've been considered irresponsible. The abruptness and unilateral nature of Trump's moves – some announced on Twitter with allies caught off guard – stand in stark contrast to the cautious, alliance-based approach of an earlier era.",

  summary: "On the economic front, Trump launched an aggressive trade war even against U.S. allies.",
  content: "On the economic front, Trump launched an aggressive trade war even against U.S. allies. He slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum from the EU, Canada, and others, claiming national security reasons. Europe and Canada were outraged and retaliated with tariffs of their own. When confronted, Trump said Americans might feel 'some pain' from higher prices but that it was necessary. To someone from 2000 – an era of expanding free trade (with NAFTA and the upcoming WTO Doha talks) – a U.S. president deliberately igniting trade conflicts with friendly nations would seem bizarre. Back then, tariffs were seen as relics of the past; the U.S. was working on new trade agreements, not ripping them up. A trade war initiated by America against its closest trading partners, potentially harming its own consumers and industries, would be quite perplexing.",

  content: "Trump also escalated tariffs on China, eventually taxing most Chinese imports and prompting China to retaliate in kind. This trade war seesaw hurt farmers (China cut soybean purchases, for example) and led to supply chain disruptions. Trump's comment that 'trade wars are good, and easy to win' did not exactly bear out, as negotiations dragged. In the year 2000, China had just joined the WTO and the prevailing wisdom was that integrating China into global trade would liberalize it. The abrupt shift to a confrontational tariff war – and using blunt tariffs rather than international rules to address grievances – would strike someone from 2000 as a risky, last-resort measure being used first. They'd be surprised that the U.S. president willingly put American businesses in the crossfire of a massive tariff crossfire (something more associated with 1930s protectionism than the 2000s globalism).",

  content: "On climate change, Trump's actions have been drastic. He withdrew the U.S. (again) from the Paris Climate Agreement on Day One, despite 2024 being the hottest year on record. In an inaugural rally, he declared the accord a 'one-sided…rip-off' and said the U.S. would not 'sabotage our own industries while China pollutes with impunity'. He simultaneously declared a 'national energy emergency' to boost fossil fuel production, giving himself broad powers to waive environmental laws. He opened up more federal lands and offshore areas for oil drilling and rolled back limits on coal plants. To someone in 2000, when the U.S. had just negotiated the Kyoto Protocol (though not ratified) and climate science was prompting calls for action, it would be astounding that in 2025 the U.S. president is not just ignoring climate change, but actively championing fossil fuels as a matter of national pride – even as the effects of global warming (fires, storms) become ever more visible. The idea of calling more oil and coal output a 'national emergency' (usually a term for wartime or disasters) would be utterly perplexing.",

  content: "The Trump administration undertook a sweeping rollback of environmental regulations. They went so far as to eliminate the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) rules that require environmental impact studies for big projects. This NEPA process had been in place since 1970 as a cornerstone of U.S. environmental law. Now, many projects like highways, pipelines, or mines can proceed with little environmental review. Additionally, Trump's EPA reversed or weakened dozens of clean air and water rules – from allowing higher mercury pollution from power plants to loosening safety rules imposed after chemical plant explosions. An American in 2000, accustomed to steady strengthening of environmental standards (the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, etc.), would be shocked to witness an administration almost systematically dismantling protections. The notion of the U.S. 'unleashing' industry by removing basic pollution safeguards – to the point of scrapping NEPA entirely – would have seemed politically impossible and wildly unpopular in 2000.",

  content: "The Trump administration opened previously protected lands to development. For example, it green-lit drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a pristine wilderness that had been off-limits for decades. It also removed protections from vast areas of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in Utah, allowing mining claims on lands rich in Native American history. In 2000, national parks and monuments were almost sacred – the idea of shrinking a monument by 85% to allow private extraction would have caused a national outcry (indeed, no president had attempted such a rollback in modern times). To see it actually happen in 2025 – essentially prioritizing oil, gas, and mining over conservation on treasured public lands – would astonish and outrage many from that earlier time who grew up with the ethos of preserving 'America the Beautiful.'",

  content: "Time and again, Trump's America has found itself isolated in international forums. Whether on climate (where at COP summits, the U.S. delegation is now the skunk at the garden party defending coal) or at the U.N. (where the U.S. vetoed resolutions it once would have supported, like humanitarian aid funding, because they mention reproductive health or climate), America under Trump often stands alone or with a few outliers like Russia or Saudi Arabia. In 2000, the U.S. usually led coalitions and built consensus on global challenges. The spectacle of other countries openly criticizing the U.S. as a blocker – for instance, diplomats lamenting that 'the U.S. is holding the world hostage on climate action' – would be a shocking role reversal. It would seem as if the U.S. no longer aspires to be the 'shining city on a hill,' but rather an obstinate superpower uninterested in solving global problems, which would deeply surprise those from an era when U.S. global leadership was taken for granted.",
