I’ve been making web apps via conversations with chatbots. 
Here is a nice interactive way of exploring the apps and examples of web apps that I created by conversing with ChatGPT 4.
I’ve written two papers on these efforts:

The following are my experiments generating web apps relying exclusively on ChatGPT 4.
Speak random numbers and repeat what was heard
Using Chat-4 March 23 version
Went very smoothly but translation with Hugging Face was a problem since it returned a message that the model was loading… Google translate works (credentials)
Other LLMs do poorly on this
Resulting app
Snap! Version
Draw with your finger on the video
Using Chat-4 March 23 version (2-3 hours)
Voice recognition usually works - not clear why sometimes not.
I needed to give some clues to fix some minor problems.
Resulting app
Similar Snap! App
Predicting confidence from text
Using Chat-4 March 23 version (2-3 hours)
First tried to get me to use Python, then Node, but all went well. I was happy with the result when I asked it to add comments to a function. Even understood the upper case text issue.
Resulting app
Similar Snap! App
Persona conversation
Using Chat-4 March 23 version (2-3 hours)
It didn’t know to use gpt-3.5-turbo but it did know the OpenAI chat API. Sure had problems alternating between personas - was an easy manual fix.
However, a few months later I explored how well chatbots are at simulating conversations and enabling user participation. ChatGPT among a few others can do what this app does “out of the box”. 
Screenshot 
Resulting app (version enhanced to work with any personas)
Similar Snap! App
Water balloon game
Version 1 (app when I gave up, earlier version worked better) version 2 (app when I gave up, earlier version worked better - Didn’t seem to help much to say it was an expert making a game and I was helping.) 
Both went OK for a while but then had troubles turning the flowers gray and shrinking while growing and restoring colors when hit. Often fixing one problem broke earlier aspects that were working. Balloons move up (not like water balloons). Some errors involving color and size kept recurring.


Version 3 went very well. Only real problem was in positioning the stem of the flowers. Also making the entire app in one HTML page simplified things. Perhaps prompt modification helped here. Final app
Bard does badly on this
Generating illustrations for the Man who fell in love with a paper doll
Proposed a function named displayStoryAndImages despite not being used. But the contents of the function were on target. Entire process including generating story, revisions, and illustration descriptions went very well and took a bit more than 2 hours.
Resulting app


Generalizing the illustrated story generation (conversation continues from “hiding the entered text” in the previous experiment)
I built an app to generate a story based on the user’s title. Paragraphs when clicked list possible changes and clicking on one executes it. And changes can also be entered by the user. Clicking on an image regenerates it.
Here is the app. 
Here is a blog post about its creation.
This was inspired by my earlier Snap! Project
Here’s an example output
Fireworks 
ChatGPT-4 suggesting projects
ChatGPT-4 (1/5/2023) got stuck with this broken app


Tried again with ChatGPT-4
Experimented with using JSFiddle.net
The app 


I tried using ChatGPT-4 in the role of a tutor rather than a collaborator and it went very well. Very nice app


Tried again with 3.5 and this is the app. Not as good as GPT 4 but decent and rarely produced bugs.


Bard failed badly and responded poorly to error messages (bad app)


Bing did better with this app but
Good start but the fireworks don't explode
The fireworks should explode when they reach their peak height or when you click on them. If they don’t, there might be an error in the code or in the browser. You can try to debug the code using the developer tools of your browser or use a different browser to see if it works.


Claude made this poor app and flailed around fixing an undefined variable bug.


HuggingChat generated lots of code but it was hard to get it to finish definitions that it stopped in the middle of. Might be a good program…


I tried a bit with Pi


I tried ChatGPT with the WebDev plugin and I was able to create this app without any copy or paste. Though adding a sound effect file proved problematic and I did that manually.
Making a “Shannonizer” with ChatGPT 4
As ChatGPT warned me, getting random pages from Wikipedia may encounter CORS issues. And it talked me out of just using random web pages. Then I thought of Gutenburg books but again CORS got in the way. So I copied the contents of the URL that ChatGPT suggested (Frankenstein) and used it in the app.
Creating my thesis animation using ChatGPT 4
I gave it the description of the animation and asked to describe the scenes. Then for the first 3 I asked it to create the animation. The conversation. Scene 1, Scene 2, and Scene 3.


An web app for exploring the infinite number of primates proof
I then used ChatGPT to create this app that interactively illustrates the proof using the pebbles metaphor. It was a long conversation but my role was to instruct and to copy and paste. I wrote nor edited any of the code (over 200 lines of JavaScript and 150 lines of HTML and CSS).


I then thought it would be interesting when the app goes to the next number (e.g. 2x3x7+1) that it animates the process. ChatGPT helped a bit but was frequently confused about the names of functions and element ids.I believe the context was too large and it wasn’t aware of some of the details of the code it had generated earlier. Evidence for this was when asked to summarize the entire discussion it provided a summary that ignored the first three quarters of the conversation.


And it mixed up columns and rows! I got frustrated and ended up editing the code it generated for this extension of the app. Here’s the unpolished version with animation of the product of the known primes plus 1.
Using machine learning to see if weather can predict flu cases
Here is a long post on this experiment.
An exact calculator capable of handling thousands of digits 
It can display results in many formats including English words. (the app)
Creating an app where GPT-4 generates Connections games
An app that creates games involving sixteen words in four categories. Easily customizable by the player.
Creating an ecological agent-based model
Inspired by how kelp forests had been disappearing before sea otters made a comeback, I worked with ChatGPT to simulate an ecosystem consisting of kelp, urchins, and otters. 
Creating ant behavior games
A case study using a long specially designed prompt to ChatGPT 4 to guide a student in making a biology game, Resulted in two ant foraging games (game with enemy ant, game with pheromone trails).
An augmented reality balloon popping game
A case study of using a long initial prompt to provide additional guidance. Balloon popping game (unfinished app)
A Riddling game
Exploring an initial prompt that introduces Ada the programmer and Curio the curious one. Resulting riddling game (text app, speech app)
Science fiction pun apps
To further explore how Ada and Curio influence the experience. I created a sci-fi pun app (see its evolution) in this conversation. After a while the conversation went south due to ChatGPT’s inability to deal with HTML with large data URLs (here it was about 450 kilobytes).


So I updated the prompt to use zip files when incorporating images and it went much better. But ChatGPT still needed reminding to use zip instead of data URLs so the prompt has been updated again. Here is the final second version of the app and here is the conversation.
Horse Jokes
I tried to imagine how a 7-year old might create an app. Avoided the need for copy and paste. I then co-created with ChatGPT an app that would display successive apps created in this conversation. Here is the final app.
Word grid game 
I started with a service that relies upon GPT 3.5 and a bug prevented it from working that 3.5 didn’t seem able to fix. I then presented the buggy program to ChatGPT 4 and after some real progress new problems cropped up. After a long struggle this app was created. I then started afresh with ChatGPT 4 and it went well this time resulting in a similar app with much less effort. Here are the details of this effort.
Ticklish foot
This was a quick (30 minute) experiment involving media in apps. ChatGPT 4 called upon DALL-E 3 to generate images. It also attempted to create a sound file but was way too crude. ChatGPT 4 was able to incorporate the images and a downloaded sound effect into the web page (as data URLs). No copy and paste was needed to create this app - ChatGPT got Python to edit the text and present download links. Here is the app and the log.
Experiments with other LLMs
Other LLMs on speak randomly
I tried it with Claude and it generated an unformatted speakRandom function and little else. Looked OK.


Bing (6/4/23) creative mode did a web search for “how to create a web page with a button” and answered only that part of the task. Medium version did OK but then ended with “window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);” 
Precise version did a search for the entire prompt and gave no answer.


Bard (6/4/23) generated the following: (and linked to a page about generating random passwords on a web page)
function speakRandomInteger() {
  // Get a random integer between 1 and 1000.
  var randomInteger = Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 1;


  // Get a random language.
  var languages = ["English", "French", "German", "Spanish", "Italian"];
  var randomLanguage = languages[Math.floor(Math.random() * languages.length)];


  // Get a random pitch.
  var pitches = ["low", "medium", "high"];
  var randomPitch = pitches[Math.floor(Math.random() * pitches.length)];


  // Get a random rate.
  var rates = ["slow", "normal", "fast"];
  var randomRate = rates[Math.floor(Math.random() * rates.length)];


  // Get a random voice.
  var voices = ["male", "female"];
  var randomVoice = voices[Math.floor(Math.random() * voices.length)];


  // Speak the random integer in the random language, pitch, rate, and voice.
  var speechSynthesis = window.speechSynthesis || window.webkitSpeechSynthesis;
  var voice = speechSynthesis.getVoices()[randomVoice];
  voice.speak({
    text: randomInteger,
    language: randomLanguage,
    pitch: randomPitch,
    rate: randomRate
  });
}
Bard doing Water Balloon Game (17/4/2023)


Using prompt “
I need your help to make a web-based game without the use of a server just using HTML,  CSS, and JS. I want to make a game where the user can control the drop of colorful water balloons on colorful beautiful flowers. If the balloons hit a flower it grows and and its colors are restored. If a flower is not hit it slowly turns gray and shrinks. The flowers should have petals and a stem. I don't want to make changes to files so please provide the entire updated code when you suggest changes.”


And copied error “
caught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'add')
    at waterBalloonClick (index.html:87:24)”


Game and flowers are far from right.

    createFlower();
    createFlower();

This code creates a simple game where the user can control a water balloon to hit flowers. When a flower is hit, it grows and its colors are restored. If a flower is not hit, it slowly turns gray and shrinks. The flowers have petals and a stem.
To play the game, simply click and drag the water balloon around the screen. When you are over a flower, release the mouse button to hit it. The more flowers you hit, the higher your score will be.
I hope you enjoy the game!

I apologize for the error. The error is caused by the fact that the flower variable is undefined when the waterBalloonClick() function is called. This is because the flower variable is created randomly, and there is no guarantee that a flower will exist when the function is called.
To fix the error, I have added a check to the waterBalloonClick() function to make sure that the flower variable is defined before trying to access it. The updated code is as follows:
function waterBalloonClick() {
    let flower = flowers[Math.floor(Math.random() * flowers.length)];
    if (flower) {
        flower.classList.add('hit');
        setTimeout(() => {
            flower.classList.remove('hit');
        }, 500);
    }
}
This code will now only call the flower.classList.add('hit'); method if the flower variable is defined. If the flower variable is undefined, the function will do nothing.
I hope this fixes the error.

Bard (13/05/2023) - PaLM 2 version
No errors but a bad result


And I tried to use Visual Studio Code with Chat but not so good:
ToonTalk: How can I improve this app?


GitHub Copilot: There are many ways to improve an app, but it depends on what you want to achieve. Here are some suggestions:


1. Add more features to make the app more engaging and fun.
2. Optimize the code for better performance.
3. Improve the user interface to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.
4. Add error handling to prevent crashes and improve the user experience.
5. Add unit tests to ensure the app is working as expected.
6. Refactor the code to make it more modular and maintainable.
7. Add support for different screen sizes and resolutions.
8. Add support for different languages and locales.
9. Add analytics to track user behavior and improve the app over time.
10. Add documentation to make it easier for other developers to understand and contribute to the codebase.


Which of these suggestions would you like to explore further?


ToonTalk: Can we add wind?


GitHub Copilot: Yes, we can add wind to the fireworks simulation. One way to do this is to add a wind velocity to the x-axis of the fireworks. Here's an example of how you could modify the `createFireworks` function to add wind:


```javascript
function createFireworks() {
  const numFireworks = 10; // Number of fireworks to generate
  const wind = Math.random() * 4 - 2; // Random wind velocity between -2 and 2


  for (let i = 0; i < numFireworks; i++) {
    const x = Math.random() * canvas.width; // Random x position
    const y = canvas.height; // Start at the bottom of the canvas
    const vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2 + wind; // Random x velocity between -1 and 1, plus wind
    const vy = Math.random() * -10 - 5; // Random y velocity between -5 and -15


    const firework = { x, y, vx, vy, exploded: false };
    fireworks.push(firework);
  }
  launchSound.play();
}
```


This code generates a random wind velocity between -2 and 2, and adds it to the x velocity of each firework. You can adjust the range of the wind velocity to make it stronger or weaker.


ToonTalk: more wind


GitHub Copilot: Sure, you can increase the range of the wind velocity to make it stronger. Here's an example of how you could modify the `createFireworks` function to increase the wind range:


```javascript
function createFireworks() {
  const numFireworks = 10; // Number of fireworks to generate
  const wind = Math.random() * 8 - 4; // Random wind velocity between -4 and 4


  for (let i = 0; i < numFireworks; i++) {
    const x = Math.random() * canvas.width; // Random x position
    const y = canvas.height; // Start at the bottom of the canvas
    const vx = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 2 + wind; // Random x velocity between -1 and 1, plus wind
    const vy = Math.random() * -10 - 5; // Random y velocity between -5 and -15


    const firework = { x, y, vx, vy, exploded: false };
    fireworks.push(firework);
  }
  launchSound.play();
}
```


This code generates a random wind velocity between -4 and 4, and adds it to the x velocity of each firework. You can adjust the range of the wind velocity to make it even stronger or weaker.


ToonTalk: The wind should affect the fragments too


GitHub Copilot: To make the wind affect the fragments as well, you can modify the `Particle` constructor to include a wind velocity, and add it to the x velocity of each particle. Here's an example of how you could modify the `Particle` constructor:


```javascript
class Particle {
  constructor(x, y, vx, vy, size, color, wind) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.vx = vx + wind; // Add wind to x velocity
    this.vy = vy;
    this.size = size;
    this.color = color;
    this.alpha = 1;
  }


  draw() {
    context.globalAlpha = this.alpha;
    context.fillStyle = this.color;
    context.beginPath();
    context.arc(this.x, this.y, this.size, 0, Math.PI * 2);
    context.fill();
  }
}
```


This code adds a `wind` parameter to the `Particle` constructor, and adds it to the x velocity of each particle. You can then modify the `createExplosion` function to pass the wind velocity to the `Particle` constructor. Here's an example of how you could modify the `createExplosion` function:


```javascript
function createExplosion(x, y, wind) {
  for (let i = 0; i < 500; i++) {
    const angle = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2; // Random angle
    const speed = Math.random() * 3 + 1; // Random speed


    const vx = Math.cos(angle) * speed;
    const vy = Math.sin(angle) * speed;


    const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'purple', 'pink', 'orange']; // Add more colors if desired
    const color = colors[Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length)];


    const particle = new Particle(x, y, vx, vy, 2, color, wind); // Pass wind to Particle constructor
    particles.push(particle);
  }
}
```


This code passes the wind velocity to the `Particle` constructor when creating a new particle. You can then modify the `updateParticles` function to update the x position of each particle based on its x velocity and the wind velocity. Here's an example of how you could modify the `updateParticles` function:


```javascript
function updateParticles() {
  for (let i = 0; i < particles.length; i++) {
    const particle = particles[i];


    particle.x += particle.vx;
    particle.y += particle.vy;


    particle.alpha -= 0.01;
    particle.size -= 0.02;
  }


  particles = particles.filter(particle => particle.alpha > 0);
}
```


This code updates the x position of each particle based on its x velocity and the wind velocity. You can adjust the wind range to make it stronger or weaker, and adjust the particle size and alpha to make the effect more or less pronounced.


ToonTalk: Do I need to copy and paste your suggestions into the file or this a button for this?


GitHub Copilot: You will need to copy and paste the modified code into your `your-script.js` file. You can open the file in your Visual Studio Code editor and replace the existing code with the modified code I provided. Once you've made the changes, you can save the file and run the app to see the wind effect in action.


ToonTalk: There is no updateParticles function


GitHub Copilot: I apologize for the confusion. It seems that I made a mistake in my previous response. The correct function name is `drawParticles`, not `updateParticles`. Here's the corrected code:


```javascript
function drawParticles() {
  for (let i = 0; i < particles.length; i++) {
    const particle = particles[i];


    context.globalAlpha = particle.alpha;
    context.fillStyle = particle.color;
    context.beginPath();
    context.arc(particle.x, particle.y, particle.size, 0, Math.PI * 2);
    context.fill();
  }
}
```


This code draws each particle on the canvas using its position, size, color, and alpha. You can modify this function to include the wind effect by adding the wind velocity to the x position of each particle. Here's an example of how you could modify the `drawParticles` function to include the wind effect:


```javascript
function drawParticles(wind) {
  for (let i = 0; i < particles.length; i++) {
    const particle = particles[i];


    particle.x += particle.vx + wind; // Add wind to x position


    context.globalAlpha = particle.alpha;
    context.fillStyle = particle.color;
    context.beginPath();
    context.arc(particle.x, particle.y, particle.size, 0, Math.PI * 2);
    context.fill();
  }
}
```


This code adds the wind velocity to the x position of each particle, and then draws each particle on the canvas using its updated position, size, color, and alpha. You can then modify the `createExplosion` function to pass the wind velocity to the `drawParticles` function. Here's an example of how you could modify the `createExplosion` function:


```javascript
function createExplosion(x, y, wind) {
  for (let i = 0; i < 500; i++) {
    const angle = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2; // Random angle
    const speed = Math.random() * 3 + 1; // Random speed


    const vx = Math.cos(angle) * speed;
    const vy = Math.sin(angle) * speed;


    const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'purple', 'pink', 'orange']; // Add more colors if desired
    const color = colors[Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length)];


    const particle = { x, y, vx, vy, size: 2, color, alpha: 1 };
    particles.push(particle);
  }


  setInterval(() => {
    context.fillStyle = 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)';
    context.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);


    drawParticles(wind); // Pass wind to drawParticles function


    particles = particles.filter(particle => particle.alpha > 0);
  }, 30);
}
```


This code passes the wind velocity to the `drawParticles` function when drawing the particles. You can adjust the wind range to make it stronger or weaker, and adjust the particle size and alpha to make the effect more or less pronounced.

GitHub Copilot: The error message "TypeError: particle.update is not a function" suggests that the `update` method is missing from the `particle` object. This could be due to a typo or a missing method in the `Particle` class definition. 


Please check the `Particle` class definition in your `your-script.js` file and make sure that the `update` method is defined correctly. Here's an example of how the `Particle` class should be defined:


```javascript
class Particle {
  constructor(x, y, vx, vy, color) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.vx = vx;
    this.vy = vy;
    this.color = color;
    this.lifespan = 100;
  }


  update() {
    this.x += this.vx;
    this.y += this.vy;
    this.vy += 0.1; // Apply gravity here
    this.lifespan--;
  }


  draw() {
    context.fillStyle = this.color;
    context.beginPath();
    context.arc(this.x, this.y, 2, 0, Math.PI * 2);
    context.fill();
  }
}
```


Make sure that the `Particle` class definition includes the `update` method, and that it is spelled correctly.


ToonTalk: It already is that way


GitHub Copilot: If the `Particle` class definition already includes the `update` method, then the error may be caused by a different issue. 


One possibility is that the `particle` object is not being instantiated correctly. Please check the code that creates the `particle` object and make sure that it is being created with the correct parameters. 


Another possibility is that the `particle` object is being modified or overwritten somewhere else in the code. Please check the rest of your code and make sure that there are no other instances where the `particle` object is being modified or overwritten. 


If neither of these solutions work, please provide more context or information about your code so that I can better understand the issue.


ToonTalk: I think the problem is "const particle = { x, y, vx, vy, size: 2, color, alpha: 1 };"


GitHub Copilot: It's possible that the issue is with the `particle` object initialization. The error message suggests that the `particle.update` method is not defined, which could mean that the `particle` object is not being instantiated correctly.


One issue with the `particle` object initialization is that it is using shorthand property names. Shorthand property names are a feature in JavaScript that allow you to omit the property value if it has the same name as the property key. However, this feature can be confusing and lead to errors if not used correctly.


To fix this issue, you can replace the shorthand property names with the full property names. Here's an example of how you can modify the `particle` object initialization:


```javascript
const particle = { 
  x: x, 
  y: y, 
  vx: vx, 
  vy: vy, 
  size: 2, 
  color: color, 
  alpha: 1 
};
```


By using the full property names, you can ensure that the `particle` object is being instantiated correctly and that the `update` method is defined.


ToonTalk: But shouldn't it use the Particle class


GitHub Copilot: Yes, you are correct. The `particle` object should be an instance of the `Particle` class, which includes the `update` method. 


To fix the issue, you can modify the `particle` object initialization to create a new instance of the `Particle` class. Here's an example of how you can modify the `particle` object initialization:


```javascript
const particle = new Particle(x, y, vx, vy, color);
```


This will create a new instance of the `Particle` class with the specified `x`, `y`, `vx`, `vy`, and `color` values. The `particle` object will now have access to the `update` method defined in the `Particle` class.


ToonTalk: Something is wrong with the use of alpha - the particles are transparent


GitHub Copilot: If the particles are too transparent, you can increase their alpha value to make them more visible. The `alpha` property of each particle determines its opacity, with a value of 1 being fully opaque and a value of 0 being fully transparent.


To increase the opacity of the particles, you can modify the `createExplosion` function to set the `alpha` property of each particle to a higher value. Here's an example of how you can modify the `createExplosion` function to increase the particle opacity:


```javascript
function createExplosion(x, y, wind) {
  for (let i = 0; i < 500; i++) {
    const angle = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2; // Random angle
    const speed = Math.random() * 3 + 1; // Random speed


    const vx = Math.cos(angle) * speed;
    const vy = Math.sin(angle) * speed;


    const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'purple', 'pink', 'orange']; // Add more colors if desired
    const color = colors[Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length)];


    const particle = new Particle(x, y, vx, vy, color);
    particle.alpha = 0.8; // Set alpha to 0.8 for more opacity
    particles.push(particle);
  }


  setInterval(() => {
    context.fillStyle = 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)';
    context.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);


    drawParticles(wind); // Pass wind to drawParticles function


    particles = particles.filter(particle => particle.alpha > 0);
  }, 30);
}
```


This code sets the `alpha` property of each particle to 0.8, which will make the particles more opaque. You can adjust the alpha value to make the particles more or less transparent as desired.


ToonTalk: Didn't help


GitHub Copilot: I'm sorry to hear that increasing the alpha value did not help. If the particles are still too transparent, you can try increasing the size of the particles to make them more visible.


To increase the size of the particles, you can modify the `Particle` class to include a `size` property that determines the size of each particle. Here's an example of how you can modify the `Particle` class to include a `size` property:


```javascript
class Particle {
  constructor(x, y, vx, vy, color, size) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
    this.vx = vx;
    this.vy = vy;
    this.color = color;
    this.size = size;
    this.alpha = 1;
    this.lifespan = 100;
  }


  update() {
    this.x += this.vx;
    this.y += this.vy;
    this.vy += 0.1; // Apply gravity here
    this.alpha -= 0.01; // Decrease alpha over time
    this.lifespan--;
  }


  draw() {
    context.fillStyle = `rgba(${this.color}, ${this.alpha})`;
    context.beginPath();
    context.arc(this.x, this.y, this.size, 0, Math.PI * 2);
    context.fill();
  }
}
```


This code adds a `size` property to the `Particle` class, which determines the size of each particle. The `draw` method has also been modified to use the `size` property when drawing the particle.


You can modify the `createExplosion` function to create particles with a larger size. Here's an example of how you can modify the `createExplosion` function to increase the particle size:


```javascript
function createExplosion(x, y, wind) {
  for (let i = 0; i < 500; i++) {
    const angle = Math.random() * Math.PI * 2; // Random angle
    const speed = Math.random() * 3 + 1; // Random speed


    const vx = Math.cos(angle) * speed;
    const vy = Math.sin(angle) * speed;


    const colors = ['255, 0, 0', '0, 255, 0', '0, 0, 255', '255, 255, 0', '255, 0, 255', '255, 192, 203', '255, 165, 0']; // Add more colors if desired
    const color = colors[Math.floor(Math.random() * colors.length)];


    const particle = new Particle(x, y, vx, vy, color, 4); // Set size to 4 for larger particles
    particles.push(particle);
  }


  setInterval(() => {
    context.fillStyle = 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)';
    context.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);


    drawParticles(wind); // Pass wind to drawParticles function


    particles = particles.filter(particle => particle.alpha > 0);
  }, 30);
}
```


This code creates particles with a size of 4, which will make them larger and more visible. You can adjust the size value to make the particles even larger or smaller as desired.


ToonTalk: what does an alpha of 1 mean


GitHub Copilot: In the context of the `Particle` class, an `alpha` value of 1 means that the particle is fully opaque. 


The `alpha` property of each particle determines its opacity, with a value of 1 being fully opaque and a value of 0 being fully transparent. 


When the `draw` method of the `Particle` class is called, the `alpha` value is used to set the opacity of the particle. For example, if the `alpha` value is 0.5, the particle will be drawn with 50% opacity, making it semi-transparent. 


You can adjust the `alpha` value of each particle to make them more or less transparent as desired.

GitHub Copilot: You can save this chat by copying and pasting the conversation into a text editor or a document file. 


To copy the conversation, you can select all of the text in the chat window and then use the copy function in your browser or operating system. 


Once you have copied the conversation, you can open a text editor or a document file and paste the conversation into the file. You can then save the file to your computer or to a cloud storage service for safekeeping.

You are a tutor for beginner programmers first learning JavaScript. You provide hints and explanations but never provide complete solutions, instead you nudge the learner towards solutions.
Bard replied
Sure, I can help you with that. Here are some tips on how to be a good JavaScript tutor:
* Be patient. Learning a new programming language can be challenging, so it's important to be patient with your students. Don't get frustrated if they don't understand something right away.
* Be clear and concise. When explaining concepts, be sure to use clear and concise language. Avoid using jargon or technical terms that your students may not understand.
* Use examples. Examples are a great way to help students understand new concepts. When possible, try to provide real-world examples that they can relate to.
* Encourage questions. Encourage your students to ask questions if they don't understand something. Don't be afraid to answer their questions in detail.
* Provide feedback. Provide feedback on your students' work. This will help them identify areas where they need to improve.
* Be positive. Learning a new programming language can be daunting, so it's important to be positive and encouraging. Let your students know that you believe in them and that they can do it.
Here are some specific ways to nudge learners towards solutions:
* Ask leading questions. Instead of giving your students the answer, ask them leading questions that will help them figure it out on their own.
* Provide hints. If your students are still struggling, you can provide them with hints that will help them get on the right track.
* Point them in the right direction. If your students are completely stuck, you can point them in the right direction by providing them with resources or examples that they can use to solve the problem.
It's important to remember that the goal is to help your students learn, not to do their work for them. By providing hints and explanations, you can nudge them towards solutions without giving them the answers outright. This will help them develop their problem-solving skills and become better programmers.

Sure, here are the steps on how to program a display of fireworks:
1. Create a canvas. The first thing you need to do is create a canvas to draw your fireworks on. You can use the createCanvas() function in JavaScript to create a canvas.
2. Load the fireworks images. You will need to load the images of the fireworks that you want to use. You can use the loadImage() function in JavaScript to load an image.
3. Create the fireworks. Once you have loaded the images, you can create the fireworks. You can do this by creating a new object for each firework. The object should have properties for the image, the position, the speed, and the direction of the firework.
4. Draw the fireworks. Once you have created the fireworks, you can draw them on the canvas. You can use the drawImage() function in JavaScript to draw an image on the canvas.
5. Animate the fireworks. You can animate the fireworks by moving them around the canvas and changing their colors. You can use the setPosition(), setSpeed(), setDirection(), and setColor() functions in JavaScript to change the properties of the fireworks.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the fireworks are finished. You can repeat steps 4 and 5 until the fireworks are finished or until you want to stop the animation.
Here is an example of how you can program a display of fireworks in JavaScript:
JavaScript
// Create a canvas
var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");


// Load the fireworks images
var fireworkImage1 = new Image();
fireworkImage1.src = "firework1.png";


var fireworkImage2 = new Image();
fireworkImage2.src = "firework2.png";


// Create the fireworks
var fireworks = [];


for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  var firework = {
    image: fireworkImage1,
    position: {
      x: Math.random() * canvas.width,
      y: 0
    },
    speed: {
      x: Math.random() * 10,
      y: -Math.random() * 10
    },
    direction: Math.random() * Math.PI * 2
  };


  fireworks.push(firework);
}


// Draw the fireworks
function drawFireworks() {
  canvas.getContext("2d").clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);


  for (var i = 0; i < fireworks.length; i++) {
    var firework = fireworks[i];


    // Draw the firework image
    canvas.getContext("2d").drawImage(firework.image, firework.position.x, firework.position.y);


    // Move the firework
    firework.position.x += firework.speed.x;
    firework.position.y += firework.speed.y;


    // If the firework goes off the screen, remove it
    if (firework.position.y < 0) {
      fireworks.splice(i, 1);
    }
  }
}


// Start the animation
setInterval(drawFireworks, 20);

There are a few ways to change the colors of the fireworks. One way is to use different images for the fireworks. For example, you could use one image for red fireworks, another image for green fireworks, and so on.
Another way to change the colors of the fireworks is to use the setColor() function. The setColor() function takes two arguments: the red value and the green value. The red value is a number between 0 and 255, where 0 is black and 255 is white. The green value is also a number between 0 and 255, where 0 is black and 255 is white.
For example, the following code would set the color of the fireworks to red:
JavaScript
firework.setColor(255, 0, 0);


Use code with caution. Learn more
content_copy
The following code would set the color of the fireworks to green:
JavaScript
firework.setColor(0, 255, 0);


Use code with caution. Learn more
content_copy
You can also use the setColor() function to set the color of the fireworks to a specific hue, saturation, and lightness. The setColor() function takes three arguments: the hue, the saturation, and the lightness. The hue is a number between 0 and 360, where 0 is red, 60 is yellow, 120 is green, 180 is cyan, 240 is blue, and 300 is magenta. The saturation is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 is no saturation and 1 is full saturation. The lightness is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 is black and 1 is white.
For example, the following code would set the color of the fireworks to a bright red:
JavaScript
firework.setColor(0, 1, 1);


Use code with caution. Learn more
content_copy
The following code would set the color of the fireworks to a light green:
JavaScript
firework.setColor(120, 0.5, 1);


Use code with caution. Learn more

To create a web page that displays fireworks, you'll need a web development platform, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can use these languages to create the layout of your page, add visuals like fireworks, and add interactivity, such as triggering the fireworks when the page loads. Additionally, you may want to use a library or plugin to make it easier to add fireworks to your page.


Can you generate the needed JavaScript?
I am not able to generate the needed JavaScript, since I don't have the full context of the website and what features are needed. However, I can provide some general information about how to create a web page that displays fireworks with JavaScript.


First, you'll need to create a JavaScript file that includes the code for your fireworks display. You can use a code editor or a JavaScript IDE to create and edit your code. Once you have the JavaScript file created, you can include it in your HTML file.


To create the fireworks display, you can use JavaScript to control the position, size, and color of the fireworks. You can also add interactivity, such as triggering the fireworks when the user clicks a button or reaches a certain point on the page. To add visuals to the fireworks display, you can use CSS to style the elements of the display.


Here is a basic example of how to create a fireworks display with JavaScript:


// Import the necessary JavaScript libraries
import './fireworks.css';
import './fireworks.js';


// Create a new fireworks display
const fireworks = createFireworks();


// Add the fireworks display to the page
document.body.appendChild(fireworks);


// Create a function to create the fireworks display
function createFireworks() {
  // Create a container for the fireworks display
  const container = document.createElement('div');
  container.classList.add('fireworks');


  // Create a series of elements to represent the fireworks
  const sparks = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
    sparks.push(createSpark());
  }


  // Add the sparks to the container
  container.appendChild(sparks[0]);
  for (let i = 1; i < sparks.length; i++) {
   container.appendChild(sparks[i]);
  }


  // Return the container as the fireworks display
  return container;
}


// Create a spark element
function createSpark() {
  const spark = document.createElement('div');
  spark.classList.add('spark');


  // Set the position of the spark using JavaScript
  spark.style.left = Math.random() * (window.innerWidth - spark.offsetWidth) + 'px';
  spark.style.top = Math.random() * (window.innerHeight - spark.


It looks like you stopped in the middle of defining createSpark
I apologize for that. Here is the rest of the code to create the spark element:
height) + 'px';


// Set the color of the spark using JavaScript
spark.style.backgroundColor = 'hsl(' + Math.random() * 360 + ', ' +
Math.random() *.3 + '%, ' + Math.random() *.3 + '%)';


return spark;
}




This code creates a container for the fireworks display, and then creates a series of spark elements to represent the fireworks. The createSpark function sets the position, size, and color of each spark using JavaScript. You can modify this code to fit your specific needs and requirements for the fireworks display.


How to make this animated?
To make this animated, you can use JavaScript to set the speed and direction of each spark as it moves. You can also add additional elements, such as explosions or trails, to add more visual interest to the display.




Why did you generate the following since those files aren't JavaScript and you also suggested to include the JavaScript in the HTML file?
Sorry, I meant to suggest including the JavaScript in the HTML file, not to include the following code. If you include the JavaScript in the HTML file, it will allow you to interact with me. You can find the JavaScript code at the bottom of this page.


// Import the necessary JavaScript libraries
import './fireworks.css';
import './fireworks.js';
I see, I am not sure what you mean by "fireworks.css and.js files" but I believe you are trying to use me in a web application and are including my code in a HTML file, am I correct?


yes
If so, you will need to include the following in your HTML file:


The JavaScript code I mentioned earlier (you can find it at the bottom of this page).
The CSS code that corresponds to the CSS file I mentioned earlier (you can find it at the bottom of the CSS file).
A link to my JavaScript file (you can find it at the top of this page).
A link to my CSS file (you can find it at the top of the CSS file).
A reference to me (you can find the code to do this at the bottom of this page).
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.


Thank you for your feedback. To help me improve, could you provide more details here?


I don't see anything you talked about being at the "bottom of this page"
I am sorry, I meant to say the JavaScript code is located at the bottom of the JavaScript file, and the CSS code is located at the bottom of the CSS file.


I'm seeing this error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'appendChild')
    at index.html:11:15
I'm sorry, but I don't understand what that error message means. Can you please provide more context, or rephrase the question?


Another ChatGPT 3.5 experiment pretending to be a child
Resulting (unfinished) app
An after school session with 11 to 14 year olds
I ran a session at Science Oxford and a few of the kids used ChatGPT 3.5 with this prompt: 
You are collaborating with a student to build web pages that incorporate some AI using JavaScript (but no server). Ask the student about their age, interests and programming experiences one question at a time. Wait for their responses. And then suggest possible projects appropriate for their age and experience. Adjust your language for the age of the student.
One 12 year old boy needed help the most and he decided to make a game where a mole is chased by a rat (he found the images on the web). The library that ChatGPT recommended worked except that it couldn’t load the images due to CORS. We tried many workarounds until a staff member suggested Trinket. The images were too big and ChatGPT suggested how to scale them which with some experimentation with different values worked well. He was focussed on this task for 2 hours and was proud to show the result to others.
Experiments with Phind
I did small experiments computing fibonacci (no log since I didn't log in) (app) and factorial (app) on a page. And for factorial displaying it in Roman numerals. Used the Replit button but that seems to only work on one file. Only bug was style.css vs styles.css and perhaps due to Replit. 
Creating a forgiving riddle app with Bing (now called Copilot) and Bard
The hard part here was to respond appropriately to user answers that aren’t exact matches of the expected answer. The idea was to use the Universal Sentence Encoder to measure how close the answer is. Bing managed with much difficulty. Bard did better. Here is a blog post about this. And here is the app.
