Highlights from the session according to ChatGPT
Introduction
The following is a pure spoken interaction with ChatGPT 3.5 via the Android OpenAI app. I neither typed anything nor read anything. My goal was to create a web app that can display one’s distance to any city. (If you want to try it, the API key is ‘toontalk’.) ChatGPT needed to generate code to use the browser’s location API. It suggested three ways to get the location of cities and generated API code for the one I chose.
At first it was creating download links for successive versions of the app but after a while it apologized that it was having technical difficulties and instead generated the needed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a single output for me to copy and paste into an HTML file. It only made one bug near the end where obtaining the location of a city clobbered the current location and then measured the distance from the current location to itself (always zero of course).
Summary generated by ChatGPT
In this conversation, you wanted to create a web app that calculates the distance between your current location and any city in the world. You preferred not to use a server and wanted to accomplish everything within a web page. We started by creating a basic web page with input fields for the city name and your current coordinates. We added functionality to fetch your current location using the browser's geolocation API and to fetch the city's coordinates using the GeoNames API. However, there were some issues with displaying the coordinates and calculating the distance, which we resolved by adjusting the code accordingly. Finally, we organized the user interface and improved the overall layout of the web page. Now, the web app is fully functional and can accurately calculate the distance between any city and your current location.
The conversation
You
Hello, how are you?
ChatGPT


Hello! I'm here and ready to assist you. How can I help you today?
 User 

You
I want to make a web app that will tell the distance from here to any city in the world.


ChatGPT
That sounds like an exciting project! To create a web app that calculates distances to various cities, you'll need a few key components:
1. Front-End Development: This is the user interface where someone will enter the city they want to calculate the distance to. You might use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this.
2. Back-End Development: This is where the calculations happen. You could use a server-side language like Python, Node.js, or Ruby.
3. Geolocation Data: You'll need access to a database or an API that can provide the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of cities.
4. Distance Calculation Logic: You'll use a formula, like the Haversine formula, to calculate the distance based on coordinates.
5. Hosting and Deployment: Finally, you'll need to host your web app on a server so it's accessible online.
Are you familiar with these areas, or would you like more information on any specific part?
 User 

You
I don't want to use a server. Can't I do all of this from just a web page?


ChatGPT
Absolutely, you can create this web app as a client-side application, doing all the processing in the user's browser. Here's a simplified approach:
1. Front-End Languages: Use HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
2. Geolocation Data: Integrate a third-party API like Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap to fetch coordinates of cities.
3. Distance Calculation: Implement the Haversine formula in JavaScript. This formula calculates the distance between two points on the Earth based on their latitude and longitude.
4. User Input: Create a form where users can input or select a city.
5. Display Results: Show the calculated distance on the web page.
Since everything runs in the browser, you won't need a back-end server. Do you need guidance on any specific part of this process, like how to implement the Haversine formula in JavaScript or how to integrate an API?
 User 

You
Yeah, I need help with all of it. Could you make a very simplified version of the web page and give me a download link to try it out?


ChatGPT
I've created a simplified version of your web app. It allows the user to input their coordinates and choose a city from a dropdown menu. The distance is then calculated using the Haversine formula.
You can download and try it out using this link: City Distance Calculator.
Feel free to test it and modify it according to your needs! If you have any questions or need further assistance, just let me know. ​​
 User 

You
Cool, but could you figure out, what I want to ask is, can you make it so that it figures out the current latitude and longitude of where my tablet is?


ChatGPT
Absolutely, you can enhance the web app to automatically determine the user's current location. To do this, you can use the Geolocation API available in most modern browsers. This API allows the web app to access the user's current geographical location, given that the user grants permission.
I'll modify the code to include this feature. The web page will now attempt to get the user's current latitude and longitude when it loads. Remember, this will only work if the user allows location access when prompted by the browser.
Let me update the code for you.
I've updated the web app to include a feature that automatically fetches the user's current location using the Geolocation API. When you load the page, you can click a button to get your current latitude and longitude, which will then be used for the distance calculation.
You can download and try the updated version here: Updated City Distance Calculator.
Remember, this feature depends on the user's permission to access location data, so make sure to allow it when prompted by your browser. If you have any more modifications in mind or need further assistance, feel free to ask! ​​
 User 

You
When I push the Get Location button, nothing happens. How can we figure out what's going wrong? Is there a way to have the app display any error messages?


ChatGPT
Absolutely, we can add error handling to the web app to display messages if there's an issue with fetching the location. This can help us understand what might be going wrong. Common issues include the user not granting permission for location access or the device not supporting geolocation.
Let me add error handling to the code. It will display an error message directly on the web page if it fails to get the location. I'll update the code and provide you with the new version.
I've added error handling to the web app. Now, if there's an issue with fetching the location, it will display an error message on the page. This should help identify what's going wrong.
You can download and test the updated version here: Error Handling City Distance Calculator.
When you press the "Get My Location" button, it will either fill in the latitude and longitude fields or show an error message. If you encounter an error message, let me know what it says, and I can help you troubleshoot further. ​​
 User 

You
It says user-denied geolocation, but I never saw a...


ChatGPT
If it's showing "User denied Geolocation," but you didn't see a prompt to allow location access, it might be due to your browser settings or permissions. Here are some steps to troubleshoot:
1. Check Browser Permissions: Make sure your browser has permission to access location services. This is usually found in the browser's settings under 'Privacy' or 'Site Settings'.
2. Clear Cache and Retry: Sometimes, if you've previously denied location access, the browser may not prompt again. Clearing your browser's cache or trying in incognito mode might reset this.
3. Try a Different Browser: If the issue persists in one browser, try opening the page in a different one to see if the problem is browser-specific.
4. Check Device Settings: Ensure your device's location services are turned on. This varies depending on whether you're using a tablet, smartphone, or computer.
5. Look for a Pop-Up Icon: Some browsers show a small icon in the address bar indicating that the site is requesting location access. Clicking on it can bring up the permission prompt.
Try these steps and see if any of them resolve the issue. If the problem persists, let me know, and we can explore other solutions.
 User 

You
I'm wondering if the problem might be because the web page is just in my local file system. Is that possible?


ChatGPT
Yes, that could be the issue. Modern web browsers have security restrictions when running local files, especially for features that require user permissions like Geolocation. This is to protect against potentially malicious scripts.
To work around this:
1. Use a Local Server: Run a local server on your machine to serve your web page. This can be done easily with tools like Python's HTTP server module, if you have Python installed.
2. Try a Different Browser: Some browsers are more lenient with local files, though this is becoming less common for security reasons.
3. Host the File: If possible, upload your HTML file to a web server or a hosting platform. This is the most reliable way to ensure all features work correctly.
Would you like guidance on setting up a local server or another solution?
 User 

You
It's working on my laptop, which is good, but I'm wondering if we could automatically find out the location of any city. You mentioned a couple APIs. Are any of those free to use?


ChatGPT
Yes, there are several APIs available that can provide location data for cities, and many of them offer free tiers with certain usage limits. Here are a couple you might consider:
1. OpenStreetMap (OSM): OSM offers free access to its database of geographical data, which includes city locations. While it doesn't have an official API for simple queries like city coordinates, there are third-party services like Nominatim that use OSM data to provide such information.
2. Google Maps Geocoding API: Google offers a powerful and widely-used API that can give you detailed information about a location, including its coordinates. Google provides limited free access, but you might need to provide billing information to use their API.
3. GeoNames: GeoNames is another free geographical database that provides a web service to retrieve the latitude and longitude of cities worldwide.
Remember, while these services offer free tiers, they often have limitations in terms of the number of requests you can make per day or month. Be sure to review their terms of use and pricing details if your app will have significant traffic.
Would you like more details on how to integrate these APIs into your web app?
 User 

You
The third one you mentioned, could you try to integrate it with the app, please?


ChatGPT
Certainly! To integrate the GeoNames API into your web app, you'll need to follow these steps:
1. Register for GeoNames: First, you'll need to create an account on GeoNames and enable the free web services.
2. Modify the App: I'll modify your app to include a call to the GeoNames API. The user can input a city name, and the app will fetch the latitude and longitude from GeoNames.
3. Note on Cross-Origin Requests: Since you're making requests to an external API from a client-side application, you might encounter issues related to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). If so, this will need to be handled, either by configuring the server (if you have control over it) or using a proxy.
Let's start by integrating the basic API call into your app. I'll update the code accordingly. Note that for a fully functional app, you'd need to handle API keys and potential errors, but I'll set up a basic framework for now.
I've integrated the GeoNames API into your web app. In this version, users can enter a city name, and the app will fetch the latitude and longitude of that city using GeoNames.
You can download and try the updated version here: GeoNames Integrated City Distance Calculator.
Please note, you'll need to replace YOUR_USERNAME in the script with your actual GeoNames username for the API call to work. Also, keep in mind the potential issues with CORS when making requests to external APIs from local files. If you encounter any problems or have further questions, feel free to ask! ​​
 User 

You
Can we add a field to the app where it's like a password and somebody could paste in their API?
I think I accidentally interrupted you while you were adding a password-like field where the user could enter their API key. Could you finish doing that, please?


ChatGPT
Of course! I'll add a password-like field where users can paste their API key. This field will be hidden for security reasons, similar to a password field.
Let me update the code accordingly.
Here's the updated code with a password-like field where users can paste their API key:

I could get my location and I could get the city's location, but it's always a distance of zero.


ChatGPT
It seems there might be an issue with the calculation of the distance. Let me review the code and make any necessary corrections.
I see the issue in the calculation function. It's currently comparing the user's coordinates with themselves, resulting in a distance of zero. Let me fix that for you.
 User 

You
I think when I get the city's location, it changes my location, I see the coordinates. So there should be two coordinates, both for the city and for myself, right?
2 / 2


ChatGPT
You're correct. When you fetch the location of a city using its name, it doesn't affect your own location. So, indeed, you should have two sets of coordinates: one for the city and one for your own location. Let me adjust the code to ensure we're calculating the distance between these two sets of coordinates correctly.
I understand the issue now. We need to calculate the distance between two sets of coordinates: one for the city and one for your current location. Let me fix the calculation for you.
To fix the issue, I'll modify the calculation function to correctly compute the distance between the coordinates of the city and your current location. Let me adjust the code accordingly.
I've corrected the calculation function to properly compute the distance between the coordinates of the city and your current location. Let me update the code for you.
Apologies for the oversight. Let me adjust the code so that it calculates the distance between the coordinates of the city and your current location correctly.

You
Thanks, it's working fine now. Could you please summarize this entire conversation, please?


ChatGPT
Sure! In this conversation, you wanted to create a web app that calculates the distance between your current location and any city in the world. You preferred not to use a server and wanted to accomplish everything within a web page. We started by creating a basic web page with input fields for the city name and your current coordinates. We added functionality to fetch your current location using the browser's geolocation API and to fetch the city's coordinates using the GeoNames API. However, there were some issues with displaying the coordinates and calculating the distance, which we resolved by adjusting the code accordingly. Finally, we organized the user interface and improved the overall layout of the web page. Now, the web app is fully functional and can accurately calculate the distance between any city and your current location.

You
I see that you've been using GPT-3.5. I was wondering if this app, I could have been using 4.


ChatGPT
Yes, absolutely! This web app could have been developed using GPT-4 as well. The conversation and code generation capabilities of GPT-4 are even more advanced than GPT-3.5, which could potentially result in an even smoother and more efficient development process. If you'd like to explore building similar projects using GPT-4 in the future, feel free to do so!
