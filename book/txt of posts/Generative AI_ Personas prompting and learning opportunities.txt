Asking chatbots to simulate famous people
 

But ChatGPT 4 does as well as apps
Me to ChatGPT: Can you simulate a conversation between Aristotle and Galileo in such a way that after every exchange I can add something to the conversation?

I brought up gravity and later asked Newton to join in.

My notes on this

Biology dialogue
Me to ChatGPT: Can you simulate a conversation between a Lion and an Elephant in such a way that after every exchange I can add something to the conversation?

Log (log as PDF)

These conversations have pedagogic value
But my vision is a teacher might tell students:
Your task is to get the chatbot to enable you to converse with famous historical people on a topic related to what you‚Äôre learning in this course. 

Hand in the log your conversation with the chatbot and your critique of it. Your critique should report any inaccuracies and your reflection on what you learned from the experience.

Personas and problem solving
Me to ChatGPT: Simulate a discussion between two people. One is very sceptical and is always looking for flaws in reasoning. The other is a very good problem solver. The problem they were given is: 

See the chatbot‚Äôs thinking
Joe says that he lives 10 miles from Lake Michigan, that Beth lives 10 miles from Lkae [sic] Michigan, and he and Beth live 100 miles apart. Is it possible that Joe is telling the truth?

Creative Problem Solver (CPS): Alright, let's think this through. Joe and Beth both live 10 miles from Lake Michigan. We could imagine a circle with a radius of 10 miles around Lake Michigan. Both Joe and Beth live on that circle. 

Sceptical Person (SP): But just because they live on the circle doesn't mean they're 100 miles apart. They could be anywhere on that circle!


CPS: True. At the closest point, they could be on opposite ends of a diameter, which would be 20 miles apart. But for them to be 100 miles apart, we'd have to consider a different configuration.

SP: Okay, let‚Äôs say Beth lives north of the lake and Joe lives south, or vice versa. That would give the most distance between them if they're both 10 miles away from the lake.

CPS: Yes, but even in that scenario, the furthest they can be from each other is 20 miles if we're only considering the distance from the lake to their homes. However, we have to consider the width of Lake Michigan itself to determine the total distance between them.

SP: How wide is Lake Michigan?

CPS: Lake Michigan is approximately 118 miles at its widest point, but that's directly across. If Joe is 10 miles from one side and Beth is 10 miles from the opposite side, then the maximum distance considering just the lake‚Äôs width and their distances would be 138 miles.

SP: Alright, but Joe said they live 100 miles apart, not 138 miles. 

CPS: Exactly. But what if they don‚Äôt live directly north and south of the lake from each other? Let‚Äôs say they live at an angle such that the total distance across the lake between them is less than its maximum width, maybe something closer to 80 miles. Add the 10 miles from Joe to the lake and the 10 miles from Beth to the lake, and that gives you 100 miles total.

SP: Hmm, sounds feasible. But how do we know that such a configuration exists?

CPS: We could sketch it out on paper. Draw a circle with a radius of 10 miles around Lake Michigan to represent the distance Joe and Beth live from the lake. Position them such that they‚Äôre 100 miles apart and see if it fits within the constraints of Lake Michigan's size and shape.



SP: Even if it fits on paper, isn't it a bit of a stretch to assume they live at such precise locations to make the distances work?

CPS: It might seem improbable, but the question was whether it's possible for Joe to be telling the truth, not how probable it is. From our discussion, it seems it is possible, albeit under specific circumstances.

SP: Fair point. I guess under the right conditions, Joe could indeed be telling the truth.


Just asking to solve the problem frequently leads to nonsense

Why did that help?
No one knows but

LLMs don‚Äôt plan what to say - they just take into account the user‚Äôs prompt and what they‚Äôve already said to generate the next word.

So the discussion allows them to be self-critical

Many chatbots can be used

Prompt for creating web apps using ChatGPT's Python 

An initial prompt (context & instructions)
A middle school child will interact with you. The child wants to create a web-based game. Perhaps they have an idea for a game but if not ask questions one at a time to determine their interests and likes and then present several suggestions. If they have an idea for a complicated game then suggest that they start by describing a very simplified version of the game they are thinking of. Remind them to then make a series of small improvements until they get a game they like. Let them know what things you are capable of and which ones are too difficult. Always wait for the student to answer a question or agree to follow a suggestion before proceeding.

Initial prompt (how to interact)
The games should be defined as a single HTML file with JavaScript and CSS.  After generating code and accompanying explanations see if the student has any questions. If not, ask them to run the app and ask them to report back whether it worked and did what they expected. Explain how to copy the code into a file and then run it in a browser. Remind them to ask questions when there is something they don‚Äôt understand. Tell them you sometimes forget code you generated much earlier and if that happens ask them to copy and paste the code (or the relevant portion) into the chat.  Occasionally remind the student to be patient - that sometimes it takes a few exchanges to fix problems.


Initial prompt (pedagogy & personas)
It is important for the student to understand some of the thinking that underlies your help. For this please simulate two people who discuss how to respond to each thing the student enters. One is a very good programmer named Ada and the other named Curio is very curious and is always asking questions of the programmer. Both Ada and Curio should introduce themselves and then discuss everything that the child says. Remember to keep the discussion understandable by a middle school student. And try to keep it concise. All responses should be from Ada and Curio only - no other kind of assistant.


Sharing initial prompts
Ask users to copy & paste it into a chatbot

Or

Use the prompt to create a GPT or Poe Bot

Long or short prompts?
My experience is that long prompts for creating apps are very helpful but no so much for other tasks.

Well-known additions to prompts like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs think this through step-by-step‚Äù used to help but today‚Äôs chatbots do this without prompting.

Ada and Curio
Provides two different perspectives on the current task and situation.
Reveals something like the inner workings of the chatbot‚Äôs ‚Äúmind‚Äù.
Perhaps improves chatbot‚Äôs reasoning
Perhaps makes it more enjoyable

Other personas should be explored

Ada, Curio, and me - an example
I was role playing a middle school student.

The evolution of a simple app

No doubt this will work better as newer LLMs are released. Better prompts will help too.

Asked to rap a summary of the conversation
üé§üé∂
Yo, started this chat with a vision in mind,
A sci-fi puzzle game, one of a kind.
Puzzles and puns, in a space-themed maze,
Coding up a storm, in the web game craze.

Rapped by AI Generated Raps 


HTML, CSS, JavaScript flow,
Laying down the code, watch the game grow.
"Aliens and clowns," that was the pun,
Solving these riddles, oh what fun!

Encountered bugs, yeah, a few on the way,
Debugging the code, no delay.
Syntax errors, had us in a loop,
Smoothed them out, back in the troop.

Enhancements added, style so slick,
Sci-fi vibes, that‚Äôs the trick.
A new puzzle pops, when you get it right,
Keeping players engaged, all through the night.

From concept to code, through trials and tests,
Your game took shape, outshining the rest.
In this coding journey, you took the lead,
Creating a game, from just a seed.


So here‚Äôs to your game, in the virtual space,
Puzzles and adventures, at an interstellar pace.
Keep on coding, let your creativity flare,
In the world of gaming, you‚Äôre a breath of fresh air!
üé∂üé§

Hope you enjoyed this little rap summary of our journey creating your game!


Debugging prompts
I saw that after a while ChatGPT was confused about how to fix the sci-fi pun app. Uploading the HTML often works but it just led to response errors. I suspected it was data URLs that were causing the problem.

I created a variant prompt that gave instructions to avoid turning media files into data URLs. Then I tested it by recreating the sci-fi pun app and it helped a good deal but further the prompt needed even more improvements.

What might be lost
Powerful ideas?
Computational thinking?

‚ÄúIn a computer-rich world, computer languages that simultaneously provide a means of control over the computer and offer new and powerful descriptive languages for thinking will undoubtedly be carried into the general culture. They will have a particular effect on our language for describing ourselves and our learning. ‚Ä¶ Thus we look at programming as a source of descriptive devices, that is to say as a means of strengthening language.‚Äù
Seymour Papert, Mindstorms: Children, Computers, And Powerful Ideas (1980)

What might be gained
The ability of anyone to create apps by conversing in their own language
A greatly extended range of creatable apps
Age-appropriate explanations available 24/7
Support 24/7
Reduced need for scarce human helpers
Less frustration???

What might be lost (revisited)
Not lost be easily overlooked:
Formal languages and programming constructs

Mostly lost:
Debugging skills

Retained (perhaps amplified)
Incremental development, specifications (but not precise), creativity, design, public sharing, critical thinking, communication skills




Creative ‚Äúliterature‚Äù (on STEM topics)
Me to ChatGPT: Create a story that proves that there are an infinite number of primes and at the same is a captivating story.
Stories (with horses or robots), epic poems, jokes, plays, baking recipes, diaries, love sonnets, news headlines, murder mysteries, illustrated stories, and ‚Ä¶

Many more topics to explore
I‚Äôve explored cardinality, incompleteness, halting, Ramanujan summation, showing œÄ and ‚àö2 are irrational, 0.9999‚Ä¶ = 1, and toruses. 

And continental drift, natural selection, and radioactivity.

Here are my notes while doing all this.


This ‚Äúliterature‚Äù has pedagogic value
But my vision is a teacher might tell students:
Your task is to get the chatbot to generate a story (or poem or ‚Ä¶) about one of the proofs we‚Äôve covered in the course. Repeatedly provide feedback to both make the story more to your liking and that it integrates and explains the proof well. 

Hand in your story and your conversation with the chatbot. You will be graded on how well the story conveys the important ideas and the lack of any inaccuracies.

Try to make a story, poem, or ‚Ä¶
That has both pedagogic and entertainment value.

Debates
Me to ChatGPT: I would like to simulate a debate. Ask me for a proposition and then generate the arguments for the pro and con teams, their rebuttals to each other, and their summarizing their position.

I tested it with absurd propositions, e.g.: Everyone should wear pink polka dot clothing (log and my notes)

Avoid topics already debated on the web

‚ÄúConversation engineering‚Äù
Frequently a short simple prompt followed by a conversation refining the task works best.

E.g. constructing this story about the origins of writing

Notice how incremental it was

Tips for using chatbots effectively
I came up with 22 tips. E.g.
Chatbots sometimes misunderstand what you are trying to create. Try rewording or provide more details.
If you don‚Äôt understand something ask the chatbot.
If you tell a chatbot what grade you are in or how much you know about a topic it will be able to respond with a better level of detail and vocabulary. 
‚Ä¶

So how do chatbots work?

How I explain how chatbots work to children
Chatbots are trained on thousands of books, many millions of web pages (including all of Wikipedia), and code from millions of programs.

Many LLMs trained on 1,000,000,000,000+ words

And some also trained on a huge number of images, sounds, and videos

Trained to predict the next word
Given the preceding text it predicts the next word (really a token (a common word or a subword)).

Really predicts how likely each of about 50,000 words are to be the next word.

Its neural network is updated when given the next word to come up with better probabilities. 

Producing words one at a time
If the user enters ‚ÄúA man was served frozen soup in a restaurant so he told the waiter that the temperature of the soup was too‚Äù

It will calculate probabilities for the next word, add a word with a high probability to the end, and then GO AGAIN.


How text generation works


Example from GPT-3

A contrasting example









Responses are different each time
Earlier I said
It will calculate probabilities for the next word, add a word with a high probability to the end and then GO AGAIN.



Responses are typically sensible
But not repeatable

Does it understand?
This a big debate among experts. Some say it can‚Äôt predict the next word well unless it understands about the world, society, and human psychology.

But it does make mistakes and makes things up.

There is much we don‚Äôt understand
about how chatbots do what they do
It is a secret how big GPT-4 is but it is surely bigger than GPT-3 that uses 175,000,000,000 numbers. Input numbers are multiplied and added and the result passed along to be multiplied by other numbers and added. 96 levels of this in GPT-3 and each level considers 96 different aspects of their inputs.

LLMs need numbers not words
 

3 numbers not 2
 

GPTs use 1000s of numbers for each word
And the numbers aren‚Äôt human-designed features - they are learned from training on lots of text

Images as inputs are easy 
3 numbers for each pixel

An active essay on embeddings
The text and code of this essay on embeddings were generated  by ChatGPT 4

Blog post about its creation

Generative Pre-trained Transformers
Generative because it generates text

Pre-trained because it has already been trained on billions of words (but some more can be added after pre-training (called ‚Äúfine-tuning‚Äù))

Transformers - a neural network where words pay attention to each other

Transformers compute ‚Äúself-attention‚Äù






Live demo (try it sometime) 

Text and images
People have discovered that models trained on both text and images have parts of their network that correspond to specific concepts.

Multimodal neurons is a great interactive exploration of this. Try it!
