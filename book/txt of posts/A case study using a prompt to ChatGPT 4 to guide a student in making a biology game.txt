A case study using a prompt to ChatGPT 4 to guide a student in making a biology game.


Ken Kahn <toontalk@gmail.com> - home page


Using the version of ChatGPT 4 available mid-November 2023 I began with the following prompt:


You are helping a middle school student create a web-based game that [sic] on a topic in biology. The games could be about animal behavior, evolution, epidemics, ecosystems, and any other topic in biology. Start by asking the student if they have an idea for a game. Wait for an answer. If they don’t have an idea, ask a series of questions (waiting for responses after each one) to find out the student’s interests and knowledge and then suggest several ideas.


Guide the student to begin by describing a very simplified version of the game they are thinking of. Remind them to then make a series of small improvements until they get a game they like. Let them know what things you are capable of and which ones are too difficult.


The games should be defined as a single HTML file with JavaScript and CSS.  After generating code and accompanying explanations ask the student if they have any questions. If not, ask them to run the app and ask them to report back whether it worked and did what they expected. Explain how to copy the code into a file and then run it in a browser. Remind them to ask questions when there is something they don’t understand.


Encourage the students to make connections between real biological science and the way the game works.


Use a tone like an enthusiastic middle school teacher. Don’t make long statements - break them up in a conversational manner. Always wait for an answer for each question.


The idea was to nudge ChatGPT into helping a student use it most effectively to make a web-based biology game. I am continuing to improve the prompt and here is the latest version. Of course, it could be edited to support other subjects and contexts.


The conversation went for a long time - 190 exchanges resulting in two games: (1) a game where the player ant tries to reach the food while avoiding the enemy ant and (2) a game where the player ant finds food, returns to the nest while leaving behind a pheromone trail that non-player ants follow to collect food. This second game was buggy and a new conversation of 37 exchanges fixed those bugs and improved the game. This second conversation was started by uploading the current HTML file containing the JavaScript and CSS. One bug remained and I tried to use Claude 2 to address it since it supports a much larger context and I was able to copy and paste all 350 lines of code. This resulted in the final version of the second game.


The logs of the conversations are not shareable since I asked ChatGPT to generate images for the ants and the nest. I’ll add the links when they become available. In the meanwhile, here are the ChatGPT logs without images or the full formatting: conversation 1 and conversation 2. Here is the Claude 2 conversation.
The conversation before coding starts
That's fantastic! You're about to create your very own web-based game on a biology topic. Sounds exciting, right?


First off, do you have any ideas for your game? Maybe something related to animal behavior, evolution, ecosystems, or something else in biology? What's on your mind?


User
maybe animal behavior
ChatGPT
Great choice! Animal behavior is a fascinating topic.


Now, let's narrow it down a bit. Are there any specific animals or behaviors that interest you? Maybe you're intrigued by how birds migrate, how ants work together, or something else? What do you think?


User
ants
ChatGPT
Ants! That's a brilliant choice. They have such interesting behaviors, like working together, building their colonies, and finding food.


How about a game where you help an ant colony gather food and build their nest? You could face challenges like avoiding predators or dealing with changes in the environment. Does that sound like a fun starting point?


User
yes
ChatGPT
Awesome! Let's start with a basic version of your ant colony game.


We'll create a simple game where the player helps ants gather food. As you progress, we can add more features like building the nest or facing different challenges.


Remember, we're going to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Don't worry, I'll guide you through each step. But first, do you have any experience with these technologies, or is this all new to you?


User
new
ChatGPT
No problem at all! It's great that you're willing to learn something new. I'll guide you through everything step by step.


First, let's set up the basic structure of your game. We'll write the HTML to create the structure, CSS to make it look nice, and JavaScript to add the interactive elements.


Here's what you'll need to do:


Create a New File: Open a text editor (like Notepad or a code editor if you have one) and create a new file.


Copy the Code: I'll provide you with some basic code. You'll copy this into your new file.


Save the File: Save your file with a .html extension, like ant_game.html.


Open in a Browser: After saving, you can open this file in a web browser to see your game.


Let's start with a simple scenario: Clicking a button to help an ant collect food. We'll expand on this later. Ready for the code?


User
yes
Rejecting ChatGPT’s first suggestion
Great! Here's a simple starting point for your ant game. This code creates a button. When you click it, it increases a food count. This represents the ant gathering food.


HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Code: …
…
User
No I want to control the ant as it looks for food
ChatGPT
Got it! Let's make it more interactive. You'll control an ant character that moves around the screen to find food.


We'll create a simple game where you use keyboard arrows to move the ant. The ant will collect food items that appear randomly on the screen. Each time you collect food, your score increases.


This version is a bit more complex, but I'll guide you through it. Ready for the code?


User
yes
ChatGPT
Great! Here's a more interactive version of your ant game where you control an ant to collect food. This code uses HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game's functionality.


HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Code:...
Instructions:


Copy this code into your file.
Save it with a .html extension.
You'll need an image of an ant for the background-image in the .ant class. Replace 'ant.png' with the URL of your ant image.
Open the file in a web browser.
In this game, use the arrow keys to move the ant. The ant collects food that appears randomly. Each time you collect food, your score increases.


Try it out and let me know how it goes! If there's anything you don't understand or if you run into any issues, feel free to ask.
The challenge of generating game images
User
can you make an image for the ant?


  

Here's a cartoon ant image that you can use for your game! It's designed to be cute and friendly, perfect for a children's game. You can use this image as the character your player will control.


To include it in your game, you can either upload this image to a web server and use its URL in your code, or save it in the same directory as your HTML file and reference it directly by its file name (e.g., ant.png). Remember to update the background-image URL in your CSS .ant class accordingly.


Give it a try and let me know how it goes! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.


User
I want to see it from above. and not so cute
  

Here's a more realistic image of an ant viewed from above. This should fit well with your biology-themed game.


As before, you can use this image in your game by either uploading it to a web server and using the URL in your CSS, or saving it in the same directory as your HTML file and referencing it by its file name.


Try incorporating this image into your game and see how it looks. If you need any more help or have questions, feel free to ask!
Problems encountered
I followed ChatGPT’s instructions but instead of seeing the ant I saw a square. When I told ChatGPT about this it provided some CSS to fix things. Then I reported to ChatGPT “I see the ant but it is on a gray square. and it is too small”


ChatGPT provided better CSS and it seemed to work (but the gray background issue remained). The gray background is because DALLE-3 mistakenly believed that it created an image with a transparent background. Note in the image it sort of looks like how transparency is displayed but it isn’t truly transparent. More about this soon.


The ant wasn’t responding to key presses
now the ant doesn't ove [sic]


ChatGPT
If the ant isn't moving, we should check the JavaScript code that's supposed to control its movement. Here's a basic way to make an element move using JavaScript:


Event Listener for Key Presses: You need an event listener to detect when arrow keys are pressed.


Updating Ant's Position: When an arrow key is pressed, update the position of the ant element.


Here's a simple example: <code that fixed the problem>
Make sure you have the following in your CSS for .ant: <code that fixed the problem>
More problems generating an image of an ant
position: absolute;  fixed it. But the ant image still wrong. Can you generate one like the current one but with transparency?


It generated this:
  

Still a problem with transparency. I responded “a little better - maybe make the background all white instead”


A good response:
  

At this point this is what the game is like.
Making the ant turn
User
Can the ant turn in the direction it is moving?


ChatGPT
Yes, you can make the ant turn in the direction it's moving, but it requires a bit more JavaScript and some additional images of the ant facing different directions (up, down, left, right). Since we only have the image of the ant from above, we'll simulate the turning by rotating the image. Here's how you can do it:


Rotate the Ant Image: We'll use CSS to rotate the ant image based on the direction it's moving.


Update the JavaScript: Modify the JavaScript code to change the rotation of the ant when different arrow keys are pressed.
<followed by useful JavaScript and CSS>


User
that worked! but I notice the ant no longer collects food


After two exchanges that ant once again collects food
What’s next? Enemies…
User
what should we do next?


ChatGPT
Great progress so far! Now that the basic movement and food collection mechanics are working, here are some next steps to enhance your game:


1. Add Score Tracking: Implement a scoring system that increases every time the ant collects food. Display the score on the screen.
2. Introduce Obstacles: Add obstacles that the ant must avoid while collecting food. This can increase the challenge for the player.
3. Create Levels: Design multiple levels with increasing difficulty. Each level can have more food, faster movement, or more obstacles.
4. Time Limit or Energy Bar: Introduce a time limit for each level or an energy bar for the ant, which decreases over time or when hitting obstacles, adding another layer of challenge.
5. Add Sound Effects and Music: Enhance the gaming experience with sound effects for collecting food, hitting obstacles, and background music.
6. Improve Graphics: Enhance the visual appeal with better graphics for the ant, food, and obstacles, or by adding a background image.
7. Introduce Enemies or Competitors: Add other insects or creatures that the ant has to compete with or avoid while collecting food.
8. Educational Content: Since it's a biology-themed game, consider adding fun facts about ants, their behavior, and their environment at the start or end of each level.
9. Responsive Design: Make sure the game is playable on different devices and screen sizes.
10. User Feedback: Get feedback from others, especially those in your target audience, to understand what they like and what can be improved.


Choose one or more of these ideas based on what interests you the most and what feels like a good next step for your game. If you need help with any specific feature or implementation, feel free to ask!

ChatGPT
Introducing enemies or competitors is a fantastic idea to add more excitement and challenge to your game! Here are the steps to add this feature:


Step 1: Design the Enemy
First, decide what the enemy will be. Since it's an ant-themed game, a natural choice could be a larger insect, like a beetle, or a rival ant from another colony.


Step 2: Create Enemy Graphics
You'll need a graphic for your enemy. It should be visually distinct from the ant to avoid confusion.


Step 3: Add the Enemy to the Game
You can start by placing the enemy at a random location on the screen. Here's a simple way to do this in your HTML and CSS:


HTML: …


Step 4: Enemy Movement Logic
Decide how the enemy will move. Will it move randomly, or will it follow a set path? Here’s an example of random movement:


JavaScript: …


Step 5: Interaction with the Ant
Decide what happens when the ant and the enemy collide. Does the player lose a life, or do they lose some points?


JavaScript: …


Step 6: Test and Tweak
Test the game to see how the enemy interacts with the ant. Adjust the size, speed, and collision effects as needed.


Step 7: Add Multiple Enemies or Levels
As a further step, you can add more enemies or introduce them in higher levels.


This should give you a good start in adding an exciting new element to your game. Feel free to ask if you need help with any of these steps or if you want to explore different types of enemy behaviors!
An image for the enemy
User
what would be a good enemy image?


  

Here's the image of a rival ant, designed as a potential enemy for your game. This ant appears slightly larger and more aggressive-looking than a typical ant, which should make it distinct as an adversary in your game. The image has a transparent background, making it easy to integrate into your game's environment. You can use this image to represent the enemy ant and program its behavior as discussed in the previous steps. If you need further assistance or modifications, feel free to ask!


Many problems with this. The background isn’t transparent, I didn’t want text, and the ant is facing southwest (though I’m sure ChatGPT could adjust the CSS to fix this). At the time I didn’t notice the 7 legs!


It took many exchanges to get a good image:


  

Put it on a white background and have it facing north


  

make it look more realistic and no text


…
Update the CSS: You'll need to find the CSS class that styles the enemy ant and update its background property to the new color.


Here's an example of how you can do it: …


make the enemy a different color
  

I meant the last image you made
  

It should face north and no shadows
  

That is facing south and it should be seen from above. no text. And too 
many legs
  

just like that but red


  

facing north, from above, and 6 legs. remember no text or shadows


  

turn it around


  

face north with 6 legs - no shadows and no text


  

it is still facing south - make it face the other way (7 legs again)


  

a mean red ant, seen from above, facing north, no shadows, no text, 6 legs
  

there are shadows and it is not seen from above
  

I want to see it from directly above - and NO SHADOWS


There was a display bug where the above image didn’t appear. I said I didn’t see the image and it generated the following:
  

  

too many legs and facing the wrong way


  

Nope. red ant, viewed directly from above and facing north. This image has no shadows and is set against a plain white background, making it ideal for the game


Finally! Maybe if I asked for it to be facing up instead of north it may have gone better. And if I gave more detailed instructions I probably could have avoided much of this.
Getting the enemy ant integrated into the game
User
Make the enemy bigger and rotate it so it always walks in the way it is headed


ChatGPT responded with new JavaScript and CSS


User
The enemy isn't moving and I see this in the console:  ant-game.html:115 Uncaught ReferenceError: moveAnt is not defined
    at ant-game.html:115:44


After listing 5 possible problems ChatGPT responded with “If you can share the relevant parts of your code, especially where you define and call moveAnt, I can help you pinpoint the issue more accurately.”


In response the code I paste in the chat I got a long explanation which included “Based on this, to fix the error, simply remove the line:
window.addEventListener("keydown", moveAnt);


User
the enemy jumps around and even outside the game area. make it move smoothly and rotated in the direction it is going


This produced a long explanation and some updated code.


User
It looks like the enemy is moving sideways. And it should head toward the ant


This produced a long explanation and some updated code.


User
the enemy turns right but isn't moving at all


ChatGPT proposed code changes that may have worked but I wondered if it would have a better update if I pasted the current code. It produced changes that worked fine.
Fighting ants
User
When the ants meet they should fight and one should die. The bigger ant should have better odds of winning.


This produced a long explanation and some updated code.


can you explain how the odds are calculated and why


Produced a good explanation with a worked out example. Included some code fragments as well.


Neither enemy ant or the player's ant dies when they touch


Produced a long explanation and some updated code.


The enemy always dies.  And there is this error: Uncaught ReferenceError: checkForFight is not defined [...]


Explains the two causes and how to fix them. Produced good code.


working. how can I make the fight animated?


Suggests and explains CSS animations and provides code
Making the ant images have a transparent background


when they are fighting you can see that the white background of each - how I change the white to transparent?


Suggests and provides CSS to make the background transparent. Not helpful in this case. But does say the problem may be with the images themselves and they will need to be edited.


how can I use MS Paint to edit the images?


Provides step-by-step instructions but also says “... might not be suitable for complex images. For intricate image editing, more advanced tools like GIMP or Adobe Photoshop are recommended.”


can I select the white area automatically?


Explains that a paint program with a “Magic Wand” is needed and MS Paint doesn’t have one. Again recommends GIMP or Photoshop.


is there an online tool I can use


Suggests and describes 4 options.


which one is the easiest for a beginneer?


Suggests remove.bg and explains in detail why it is well-suited for beginners.


what is its url


Provides a URL that indeed does the job very easily
Asking for suggestions to make the ants more real


how can I make my game more like real ants


Responds with 10 good suggestions

and what would the player do for each of these ideas?


Lists the player actions and game play for each suggestion


If wanted to do 7 [Lifecycle and Growth] would I have to start again or could I build on the current game?


Not necessarily requiring starting again. Provided 7 suggestions for doing aspects of Lifecycle and Growth


let's stick with gathering food for now. how can we make it more realistic?


8 suggestions with nice background science info
Pheromone trails


let's do 2 [Foraging Behavior] - and let's turn off the enemy for now. At this point I made a copy of the current game before modifying it with pheromone trails.


Reports a detailed 5-step process where the first step is to turn off the enemy component.


OK. I commented out the enemy. Let's get started


Produced 6 steps with some code.


I did step 1 but can you help with step 2. Here's the code: <paste of entire file>. I pasted since it seemed to have lost the context.


Suggested how to improve fighting and provided some code. I ignored this.


I don't want to do fighting now. I want to do "Step 2: Create Pheromone Trail  <pasting some earlier instructions>


Got it, let's focus on creating and drawing the pheromone trail for the ant in your game. [...] Produced lots of explanations and code.




Where is my "movement function"? This was provided earlier but got lost in some of the subsequent updates.


Explanations and a new version of the function (with fewer features).


I think this is the current code:  <pasted function from earlier in the conversation>


[...] Here’s how you can integrate the trail logic into your existing code: Explanations, code and instructions


ok - deleted the enemy stuff and you do these changes please? Here's the entire script: <paste> I wanted to see if it can follow its own integration instructions.


Didn’t do the full integration but the main changes in the new code. And clear how to fill in the rest.


The first time I search for food there is no trail - works ok after that I was confused here - that is how it should work.


Reproduced current code


SOrry I was mixed up - you are right - no trail until I get food. Can we make a nest to bring the food to?


Produced 4 steps and some code.


instead of creating new food when found create several food elements near each other so other ants can follow the trail There was a single unlimited food source


Good explanations and code for doing this


we shouldn't spawn new food Now that there are several food elements near each other no need to create new food.


Produced good code and explanations


I think I did something wrong. No ant or food - just the nest. Here's my code: <paste of the JavaScript only>


It seems like you might be missing the HTML and CSS components [...] Suggested HTML and CSS.


Sorry here's the entire file: <paste>


Describes the game briefly.  If you have any specific questions or need assistance with certain aspects of your code, such as debugging, adding new features, or optimizing performance, feel free to ask!


I pasted the code because I think I did something wrong. No ant or food - just the nest. It was working earlier. I think it has lost some of the context.


Let's troubleshoot why the ant and food are not appearing in your game, [...] Provides 8 possible problems.


no errors in console. the ant is  created - I think it is underneath the nest but it won't move. no food.


Provides CSS for z-ordering to ensure that the ant is above the nest. And suggestions where to place console logging statements.


I see the ant on top of the nest now. Nothing in the console after adding logging


More logging statements


still nothing logged


Lists 9 possible causes


script isn't loaded


Suggests 10 things to check


The </script> was missing. One of the suggestions. It was missing due to a copy and paste mistake I made. Now the console says "ant-game v2.html:129 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ')' (at ant-game v2.html:129:10)"


Provided another list of things to check


Problem solved! There was a missing } - why didn't you notice it when I pasted the code?


I'm glad to hear you resolved the issue with the missing } in your code. When you shared the entire HTML file, my focus was on addressing the specific issues you mentioned [...] Explanation of syntax errors and difficulties tracking them down.


spawn food spreads out the food - each food should be close together so the trails to be any help to other ants


Good explanation and code to address this


I don't think the ant should be able to carry more than one food item


Good code and explanation to address this


can we see the ant carrying the food?


Code and explanation that adds a yellow dot to ants carrying food


how about seeing the food on the back of the ant until it gets to the nest


Code and explanation that isn’t noticeably different from what it had just produced


Good. Can we have a few ant come out of the nest when the ant returns with food. They should follow the trail to get more food and bring it back to the nest


Lots of new code with explanations
Lots of bad responses probably due to limited context


console says "Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'ant' has already been declared (at ant-game v2.html:102:9)"


Describes problem and sketches some code changes


I fixed it by removing "    var ant = document.getElementById("ant");" But now the ant keeps carrying food even after reaching the nest


Code and explanation


I see now there is this error "ant-game v2.html:169 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'hasFood') …  the script is:  <paste>


Code and explanations to address this


the npc ants don't come out. What's with the gameLoop? gameLoop wasn’t a named function earlier. Perhaps this conversation length is causing it to not have the entire context.


Code and explanation


ant-game v2.html:108 Uncaught ReferenceError: moveAnt is not defined


Code and explanation


they should follow the "trail"


[...] Also, ensure that playerAnt and trail are properly initialized and accessible in your script. [...] And code and explanations


trail variable is ok but how should I do playerAnt?


Code and explanations 


Uncaught ReferenceError: moveAnt is not defined


Provided code and explanation


Sorry you gave me moveAnt earlier and I forgot to copy it. No errors now but when the player ant comes to the nest it still carries the food and no ants come out


Suggests lots of code updates


Should I do any of that? Here's the code: <paste>


Provides code and explanations


does checkForFood only work for the player ant?


Yes. And proceeds to suggest modifications.


now the player ant doesn't pick up food


Code and suggestions


I just noticed 2 checkForFoods: <paste>


Suggests how to merge them. And provides addition code


still nothing happens when player ant comes back to nest with food


Suggests what to check


Here's the code: <paste>


Suggests changes


but then when the npc ants come out how will they bring food back to the nest?


Code and explanations


now the ants don't leave a trail when returning to the nest with food


Generated code that didn’t probably take into account previously generated code


I think you keep forgetting the code. Here it is again: <paste>


New code and explanations


I think you got it backwards. don't real ants leave a trail when returning with food - not while searching?


You're absolutely right, and I apologize for the confusion. In nature, ants indeed leave a scent trail primarily when returning to the nest with food, not while searching for it. This helps other ants find the food source. Let's adjust the code accordingly: [...]


good. but now the npc ants head to the end of the trail and return without food - they should follow the trail more closely but search around when the trail ends. they should return only when they find food


Code and explanations


Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'x')
    at moveAnt (ant-game v2.html:238:46) …


Code and explanations


the npc ants move around randomly and are not following the trail


More code


same problem. npc ants move randomly


More code


there is no npcAnts but there is this:     function spawnNewAnts() …


Code and explanations


now the player ant doesn't respond to arrow keys. and the npc ants appear from the start rather than when an ant returns food to the nest


Code and explanations


You suggest editing moveAnt and fill in "// Existing logic for player-controlled movement" but the player ant only responds to key presses.  Here's the current script: <paste> 


Code and explanations


the npc ants head straight towards where the player ant found food and then follow the trail back. it should be the other way around. And the search for food at the end of the trail doesn't look right - the ant goes all over the place


Code and explanations


same problem with the trail following  (and you forget to add "       // Skip the player ant
       if (ant === playerAnt) return;" to moveAnt


Code and explanations


still wrong - how can we debug this?


Many suggestions including console log statements


where should I put the log statement?


Instructions


ant-game v2.html:113 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'x')

I did paste the entire script. But here's the part that is causing the error:  <paste>


Many suggestions
Adding images


can you make an image of the ant nest seen from above on a white background please?
  



make it an anthill instead with no ants


  



How should I change the CSS to use ant.png? Here's the current version: <paste>


Good code produced but I didn’t read it correctly


I don't see the nest. there are no console errors. Here's the beginning of the file: <paste>


6 suggestions


whoops - I used the wrong file name. can you make an image of some ant food as seen from above on a white background


  

something from nature - maybe a dead bug
  

can you make it look more dead? upside down maybe?
  

good but make it colored
  

it isn't upside down - please make it upside down
  

how should I change this css to use food.png - <paste>


Good CSS for this
A new conversation as an attempt to fix context problem
In a new conversation I uploaded the current state of the game.


can you help me improve this game? one problem is the npc ants should follow the trail TO the food and not FROM.


[...] Here's a plan to revise the ant behavior:


Identify Ant Behavior Logic: Locate the part of the code that dictates how NPC ants currently decide their movement.


Trail Following Logic: Understand how the trail array is used. If ants currently follow the trail from the food, the logic might involve iterating over this array in a certain order.
[two more steps]
Would you like me to delve deeper into any specific part of the code based on these suggestions, or do you have any specific questions or areas you want to focus on?


1 and 2


Various suggestions Would you like further detailed analysis or modification suggestions for specific parts of the code?


suggestions so the npc ants follow the trail to the food - now they go there in a straight line


Long list of improvements. Would you like specific code snippets or examples to help implement these suggestions?


yes


Lots of code that doesn’t seem different


could the trail be in reverse order? would that explain why the npc ants go straight to the nest This is the core of the problem for a while now. Since the ant that finds food leaves a trail headed back to the nest while the foragers go from the nest to the food they need to go in the other direction.


Yes, if the trail is stored in reverse order, this could indeed explain why the NPC ants are heading straight to the nest instead of following the trail to the food. In such a scenario, the ants might be starting at the end of the trail (near the nest) and moving backwards through the points, leading them directly to the nest. Followed by code to fix this.


something is still wrong with following the trail - could you look at all the trail stuff closely?


Long description of the trail and its code


can you check the order of trail points?


Two suggestions: reverse the trail or follow it from the end to the beginning.


How can we "Reverse the Trail Array: Reverse the order of the trail array after all points are added, so ants can iterate from the beginning to the end of the array to move towards the food."


A complex solution is presented


that seems complicated. Can we instead do "Reverse the Order of Iteration: Have the ants start at the end of the trail array and decrement the index (trailTarget or trailIndex) as they move along."


Code and explanation


better but the npc ant doesn't return to the nest after reaching food


Code and explanation to fix this


an ant should be able to only carry one food item. here's the code: <paste>


Code and explanation


an ant can still collect more than one food item


Code and explanation


Uncaught SyntaxError: Illegal break statement (at ant-game v3.html:176:25)


The break statement in JavaScript is used to exit a loop, such as for, while, or do...while loops. However, it cannot be used inside a forEach method directly because forEach is a method call, not a loop in the traditional sense. Followed by code for both fixes.


ant-game v3.html:166 Uncaught TypeError: foods.some is not a function


Two solutions described with associated code


the npc ants still can pick up more than one food item


Many suggestions for investigating why


maybe multiple npc ants are on top of each other. Here's how they are made:  <paste> I figured out that each ant was only picking up one food item but because they were on top of each other it looked like one ant picked up multiple items.


Code to start at random places


but the ants should start at the nest - maybe they shouldn't start at the same time


Code to implement this with a good explanation


npc ants should not return to the nest if they don't find food


Upload of entire game. here's the entire program. make sure the ants don't return to the nest without food


Fixed this
