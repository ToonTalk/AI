Asking a variety of chatbots to simulate a conversation between Aristotle, Galileo, Newton, and myself


I just had  this conversation with ChatGPT-4 (PDF of log) where I started it with


Can you simulate a conversation between Aristotle and Galileo in such a way that after every exchange I can add something to the conversation?


And then after participating in the conversation I wrote


ChatGPT - can you bring Newton into this conversation? 


I was impressed with the result. And ChatGPT 3.5 did well as well.


I tried this with Google's Bard and it did poorly. 


Claude did pretty good but not as good as ChatGPT 4


LLaMa 2 70B did OK and it's open source.


I also tried a ChatGPT-4 conversation between a lion, an elephant, and myself. Here is a similar conversation using GPT-3 (text-davinci-003). And one using LLaMa 70B.


All these experiments were done on 27/7/2023
