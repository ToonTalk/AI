Creating an ecological simulation by conversing with ChatGPT 4

Background
In October 2022 when I got access to Codex, I asked it “The following is an agent-based model of the relationship between sea urchins, otters, and kelp written in Netlogo:”. I then went on to use GPT-3 for NetLogo and JavaScript attempts to simulate this. Here are the details.
Conversing with ChatGPT 4
September 2023 I returned to this with ChatGPT 4 with the Python interpreter. After a simple agent-based Python model was working I asked to visualize the simulation and ChatGPT couldn’t do it in Python so I asked it to translate to JavaScript. Here’s the entire conversation. And here’s the final app.


I asked ChatGPT “Summarize this conversation” after the app was working well.


ChatGPT: Certainly, here's a summary of our conversation:


1. Simulation Request: You initially asked for a simulation of the ecological relationship between sea urchins, otters, and kelp. You specified that you wanted an Agent-Based Model (ABM).
2. Initial Simulation Issues: The first version had some issues with population dynamics, where either the kelp or sea urchins would go extinct quickly. We adjusted the parameters to fix this.
3. Simulation Display: You wanted to visualize the simulation. Initially, I provided a text-based representation but later transitioned to a JavaScript web app displaying a 2D grid and Chart.js for population graphs.
4. Debugging and Enhancements: We went through several rounds of debugging and enhancements, including fixing JavaScript errors and adding kelp regrowth and sea urchin and otter reproduction mechanisms.
5. Adding an 'About' Button: I added an "About" button to the HTML that opens a modal to provide information about the simulation and its creation process.
6. Reproduction Logic: We introduced logic for the reproduction of kelp, sea urchins, and otters, enhancing the simulation's realism.
7. Interactive Sliders: You wanted to add sliders to control initial population sizes and reproduction rates for the entities. I provided code snippets for you to incorporate into your HTML for this feature.
8. Styling the App: Lastly, you requested advice on making the app look "prettier". I provided a series of HTML and CSS snippets to improve the UI and UX.


Throughout the conversation, we iteratively built and refined a simulation of an ecological system, adding complexity and interactivity along the way.
Discussion
I was impressed how little technical or ecological knowledge I needed to create this app. Very few bugs were generated and they were quickly fixed. Using ChatGPT with Python worked initially and then it was a big help by doing the editing so I only needed to download an HTML file and test it. When I asked it to add comments to the entire file it did so for the first portion probably due its context limited to 4k. But after a while it grew too large and the file included comments “"// ... (existing code)". So I asked it to just tell me what edits I needed to do.


At the very end I asked for a small feature involving scrolling the display when the simulation starts. ChatGPT came up with four solutions, all of which I believe should have worked (based on MDN documentation and a quick visit to Stack Overflow). So I gave up.
