Common sense experiments with GPT

Back in November 2022 I took common sense challenges from Marvin Minsky’s chapter of the Society of Mind on common sense and language understanding and gave them to GPT 3. The results were pretty good.


Then in July 2023 I repeated this with ChatGPT 4. The first attempt resulted in lists of potential answers instead of jumping to the most likely. Prefacing a question to ChatGPT with “In the following respond with your best single common sense guess.” led to an answer about how there isn’t enough information but then provided a reasonable guess. However, prefacing questions with “In the following respond with your best single common sense guess. Make it very brief.” worked very well.


However, much has been written about Jack, Mary, and the kite since these stories were used to test the common sense of an AI program described in Eugene Charniak’s thesis from 1972. So I came up with a different set of tiny stories for testing common sense understanding. ChatGPT 4 did well on these as well.
