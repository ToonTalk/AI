Seymour Papert’s Teaching Children Thinking in the Age of Large Language Models


Ken Kahn <toontalk@gmail.com> - home page


Seymour Papert delivered a paper to the IFIPS World Congress on Computers and Education in Amsterdam in August 1970 entitled Teaching Children Thinking. Here is an earlier version.
Abstract
In Teaching Children Thinking Papert motivates the programming of computers by children. He states “the fundamental ingredients of educational innovation must be better things to do and better ways to think about oneself doing these things”.  He argues that  “computation is by far the richest known source of these ingredients”.


Here I explore whether we can maintain his vision in the age of LLMs (large language models such as ChatGPT). In my paper Programming as a Dialogue with GPT-4: Is this the future of programming? I explore the “doing better things“ half of Papert’s vision but leave acquiring “better ways to think about oneself doing these things” unanswered. In the spirit of Twenty Things to Do with a Computer (1971) by Seymour Papert and Cynthia Solomon I present a large variety of programming projects that can be accomplished by conversing with ChatGPT in my paper. I view this paper as being in the spirit of Teaching Children Thinking. My focus is how can LLMs provide not just a new way of enabling children to do large-scale creative projects on a computer, but also support reflection for acquiring thinking and problem solving skills.
Comments on quotes from Papert’s paper
Here I comment on excerpts from Teaching Children Thinking.


The purpose of this essay is to present a grander vision of an educational system in which technology is used not in the form of machines for processing children but as something the child himself will learn to manipulate, to extend, to apply to projects, thereby gaining a greater and more articulate mastery of the world, a sense of the power of applied knowledge and a self-confidently realistic image of himself as an intellectual agent. Stated more simply, I believe with Dewey, Montessori and Piaget that children learn by doing and by thinking about what they do. And so the fundamental ingredients of educational innovation must be better things to do and better ways to think about oneself doing these things.


I will attempt to demonstrate that the technology of LLMs enables the child to “learn to manipulate, to extend, to apply to projects, thereby gaining a greater and more articulate mastery of the world, a sense of the power of applied knowledge and a self-confidently realistic image of himself as an intellectual agent.” Papert’s examples of “better things to do” are designing, constructing, debugging and sharing computer programs. I also will argue that creating apps by conversing with LLMs has at least two advantages over programming: (1) the range of apps and their capabilities is much greater and (2) much less expertise and specialized knowledge is required to create apps. The most obvious potential disadvantage is that it may not support “better ways to think about oneself doing these things” as well as programming does.


Ideally experience with programming enables a kind of self-reflection of one’s own thinking and problem solving that is significantly enhanced when computational concepts such as representations, abstractions, processes, modularity, and procedures are mentally available. The process of programming involves recursively breaking problems into smaller pieces and debugging the pieces and their interactions. Due to the interactive nature of programming environments (including Logo’s command line interface) and the relative ease of modifying code, programming projects have major advantages over construction projects involving physical objects. Finally, a student’s reflections on any large-scale project can provide insights into how to allocate time, make plans, revise plans, deal with obstacles, get help, and more.


Conversing with an LLM to create an app involves communicating a greatly simplified version of the ultimate goal followed by a series of small improvements and enhancements. Testing and providing feedback at each step is critical. Both programming and LLM-aided construction involve the skills of describing computational artifacts but in vastly different ways. LLMs support the rapid construction of malleable prototypes that may enable more ambitious projects than those that most students are capable of programming. And both means of app creation support large-scale reflective projects.


I claim that computation is by far the richest known source of these ingredients. We can give children unprecedented power to invent and carry out exciting projects by providing them with access to computers, with a suitably clear and intelligible programming language and with peripheral devices capable of producing on-line real-time action.


All still true if one substitutes “LLMs” for “a suitably clear and intelligible programming language”.  I argue that LLMs provide an even greater “unprecedented power” since they can draw on thousands of APIs and code libraries to empower apps co-created with students to include capabilities ranging from vision, text and image generation, gesture recognition, prediction, data analysis, and machine learning.


Thus in its embodiment as the physical computer, computation opens a vast universe of things to do. But the real magic comes when this is combined with the conceptual power of theoretical ideas associated with computation.


Computation has had a profound impact by concretising and elucidating many previously subtle concepts in psychology, linguistics, biology, and the foundations of logic and mathematics. I shall try to show how this elucidation can be projected back to the initial teaching of these concepts. By so doing much of what has been most perplexing to children is turned to transparent simplicity; much of what seemed most abstract and distant from the real world turns into concrete instruments familiarly employed to achieve personal goals.


What are the “theoretical ideas associated with computation” relevant here? Some ideas are at the level of variables, naming, conditionals, iteration, recursion, data structures, and procedural abstraction. LLMs can automate the generation of the programming language constructs needed and if a student merely copies and pastes generated code they will have little exposure to these ideas in a detailed formal manner. I believe, however, that a motivated student can learn those ideas more readily with the help of LLMs. Even students that ignore the explanations the LLM gives still have to communicate the need for repetition, conditional action, and memory in their apps.


Maybe there is more overlap between programming and LLM-assistance regarding higher- level computational ideas. Modularity and interacting processes may be examples. 


The most important (and surely controversial) component of this impact is on the child's ability to articulate the working of his own mind and particularly the interaction between himself and reality in the course of learning and thinking.


An open question is how important is the formality of the descriptions of computational ideas to having this impact. Are informal natural-language based descriptions and experiences good enough?


Below I’ll introduce a novel twist on this question. If one instructs the LLM to open up its “thinking” will that help children acquire better ways of introspecting on their own thinking?


… why do we not teach them to think, to learn, to play?


Right, we should.


… another important aspect of having children do their work with a computer: the possibility of working on projects with enough duration for the child to become personally—intellectually and emotionally—involved.


Ambitious projects can be supported by LLMs. Yes, the children need some guidance in doing so but that can largely be provided by the LLM itself. I believe that my LLM-aided projects that took me twenty hours could have been done by a child. And with only a browser and an LLM they can have project help 24/7.


An open question regarding being emotionally involved in a project is whether the usual LLM behavior of being very positive and encouraging might play an important role. ChatGPT frequently responds very positively to a user’s suggestion before implementing it. And it provides encouragement to persevere when things are going wrong. 


The most exciting single aspect of the experiment was that most of the children acquired the ability and motivation to work on projects that extend in time over several days, or even weeks. … Our goal is to achieve a work style similar to that of the better art classes, where a child might work over a period of several weeks on making an object....


I’m optimistic that this also applies to LLM-assisted projects.


The similarity has several dimensions. The first is that the duration of the process  is long enough for the child to become involved, to try several ideas, to have the experience of putting something of oneself in the final result, to compare one's work with that of other children, to discuss, to criticise and to be criticised on some other basis than " right or wrong." The point about criticism is related to a sense of creativity that is important in many ways … —including, particularly, its role in helping the child develop a healthy self-image as an active intellectual agent.


LLMs can provide constructive feedback as projects progress. This is in addition to that from other children and perhaps is more useful. I believe that children will feel that the resulting app is their creation, not primarily the computer’s. However, I do worry as LLMs become more capable the child’s role will shrink. The day may come when a child can simply ask an LLM for an app and not need to have a long back and forth with the chatbot. Will this mean that the child will learn little and not change their self-image?
An example of constructing an app with a relatively transparent chatbot
I experimented with the following initial prompt to ChatGPT (version 4 mid-November 2023):


A middle school child will interact with you. The child wants to create a web-based game. Perhaps they have an idea for a game but if not ask questions one at a time to determine their interests and likes and then present several suggestions. If they have an idea for a complicated game then suggest that they start by describing a very simplified version of the game they are thinking of. Remind them to then make a series of small improvements until they get a game they like. Let them know what things you are capable of and which ones are too difficult. Always wait for the student to answer a question or agree to follow a suggestion before proceeding.


The games should be defined as a single HTML file with JavaScript and CSS.  After generating code and accompanying explanations see if the student has any questions. If not, ask them to run the app and ask them to report back whether it worked and did what they expected. Explain how to copy the code into a file and then run it in a browser. Remind them to ask questions when there is something they don’t understand. Tell them you sometimes forget code you generated much earlier and if that happens ask them to copy and paste the code (or the relevant portion) into the chat.  Occasionally remind the student to be patient - that sometimes it takes a few exchanges to fix problems.


It is important for the student to understand some of the thinking that underlies your help. For this please simulate two people who discuss how to respond to each thing the student enters. One is a very good programmer named Ada and the other named Curio is very curious and is always asking questions of the programmer. Both Ada and Curio should introduce themselves and then discuss everything that the child says. Remember to keep the discussion understandable by a middle school student. And try to keep it concise. All responses should be from Ada and Curio only - no other kind of assistant.
A fairy and monster riddling game
Here I describe the construction of a riddling game starting with that initial prompt. Here is the text-based version of the game and the speech input version. The game has a player character that looks like a fairy. If she touches the monster a riddle is presented textually and verbally. If the player answers correctly a treasure appears and the monster moves.


I believe this worked very well. Here is the entire conversation (note that the “live” log of a ChatGPT conversation that is normally available isn’t currently available due to the inclusion of image generation. Hence this link is to a PDF without good formatting) consisting of 72 interactions. Below I discuss how this was made and highlight some of the interactions.
Summary of the conversation
I tried to role play a middle school student. I started by saying I didn’t know what to do. In response to a question I claimed to like Zelda games. It came back with a bare-bones graphical adventure game where a player can move a character with arrow keys. I accepted this but clearly could have suggested something else. ChatGPT later gave many suggestions for what to add next but I suggested instead a riddling monster. When asked for riddles I ask ChatGPT to come up with them. It came up with 3 and suggested I add more which I ignored. I suggested the player gets a treasure when they answer correctly. When that was working I asked for a new treasure each time you got it right. I also asked for a way to give up on a riddle.


There was also a good deal of interaction trying to get nice images for the fairy, monster, and the treasure. That went well except for the issue of transparent background. Instead of generating true transparency it displayed the checkerboard pattern often used to depict transparency. Note that in another conversation with ChatGPT I asked if I could make the background transparent using MS Paint. It said no and suggested tools such as GIMP. I then asked if there was an online tool and it pointed me to one that was trivial to use.


I then asked for the riddles to be spoken. That was swiftly done so I asked if the player could speak the answer to the riddles. That also went well but when testing a web page hosted on the local file system the browser asked for permission to use the microphone every time. Trying to get ChatGPT to fix that led to more problems.


In total I entered about 700 words (which of course could have been spoken instead).
What I did to create the game
Here is everything I entered as I was trying to role play a middle school student with no programming experience (ChatGPT, me, my comment):
1. [...] What are your thoughts or questions so far? don't know what to do
2. [...] So, let's brainstorm! What are some of your favorite games, or what's something you think would be cool in a game? [...] i like the Zelda games
3. [...] Once you're ready, we'll start by setting up the basic structure of the game in HTML and JavaScript. We'll go at your pace and make sure everything is clear. ok
4. Reasonable explanations and code generated. [...] Once you have the file ready and open in your browser, tell us, and we'll continue with adding movement and interactions. [...] all i see is a white screen
5. More reasonable explanations and code generated. i don't know where to put all this
6. Reasonable instructions and code generated. [...] Take your time and let us know how it goes! maybe it is working. what should I see?
7. Good answer. it looks like that
8. Good code generated to move the player character and explanations. it is working - but is it ok that I can move the blue square outside the green one?
9. Good response with updated code. working! I want the player to look like a girl fairy
10. Generated CSS to badly approximate a fairy. better than a square but not like a fairy really
11. More not very good fairy CSS. do you see how it looks?
12. [...] we're relying on your feedback to understand how it appears in your browser [...] how can i show you how it looks?
13. [...]  If you're finding it challenging to get the look you want with CSS and HTML, another option is to use an image of a fairy as the player character. You could find or create a small fairy image and then use it in your game. [...] Followed by CSS to use an image. can you make the image of a fairy. she should have butterfly wings and wear a pretty pink dress
14.   Followed by instructions on how to download and use this in the game. The CSS was not scaling the image, however, so only the corner of the image was displayed. Also note the failed attempt to have a transparent background. it looks different - was I supposed to remove all the player css?
15. Yes [...] Adjust the Size: [...] You might need to experiment with these values to get the size just right.[...] i don't know how to adjust the size
16. Example CSS is provided to adjust the size. i tried 100 but all i'm seeing are gray squares
17. Good image CSS finally provided along with a long explanation. looks good but now she's not moving
18. Repeated moving code and updated the fairy CSS referring to your_fairy_image.png (with instructions to use the correct path). by the way I named the file fairy.png
19. Updated the CSS with the correct file path and repeated the movement code. working even though i didn't copy the new code 
20. [...] Congratulations on getting your fairy character moving in your game. It's a big step in game development! What would you like to work on next? how about a cute monster that if you answer its riddle you get a treasure
21. That's a fantastic idea! Followed by a 3-step plan and new code. nothing happens when the fairy touches the monster
22. Presents 3 possible problems and their remedies and presents code for increasing the distance threshold for triggering “touching”. working now. can you make an image of a cute monster for the game
23.   Followed by good instructions. working! I tried answering "a candle" and it said that was wrong
24. Responded with an explanation and code that trims white space and converts to lowercase. Good ideas but doesn’t address the current problem. still doesn't like "a candle"
25. Responded with code that accepts either “candle” or “a candle”. I assume it could have looked for “candle” as a substring of the response as a general solution but perhaps was trying to keep the code simple for a middle school student. working now. how should we add the treasure to the game?
26. Responded with good code and explanations. Uses CSS for the treasure but suggests the child may want an image instead. lets use an image
27.   Together with code, explanations, and instructions. how can we make the monster and treasure bigger?
28. Provides sample CSS and instructions. how can we make it have different riddles each time you play?
29. Good explanation of how to do this including a discussion of what Math.random() does. Code includes 3 riddles followed by “// Add as many riddles as you like”. Note that by adding multiple riddles it reverted to accepting only one word answers. great! can the monster move after getting a riddle right and each treasure ends up at a different place?
30. Nice explanation and code generated. the treasure moves rather than getting a new one
31. Nice explanation and code generated. how about letting the player give up on a puzzle
32. Nice explanation and code generated. good but when the player gives up tell them the answer
33. That's a thoughtful addition! Followed by nice explanation and code. thanks. everything is on some kind of checker board. can we have them all on a green background?
34. ChatGPT doesn’t understand the problem and code fixes don’t help. not any different. would it help if I gave you whole code?
35. Yes. Followed by lots of code that doesn’t fix things. you know the images you gave me had this checker pattern
36. A long discussion of the problem followed by “if the checkerboard pattern is part of the images themselves and not just indicating transparency, you might need to use different images or edit the current ones to remove the checkerboard pattern.” let accidentally entered incomplete request
37. It seems like your message was cut off. [...] let's remake the images
38. Similar images with the same problem. Also responses no longer are from Ada and Curio. there is still a checker background - can you make the background green?
39. Regenerated images with different shades of green background. much better but the background should make the game background color much better but the background should make the game background color
40. [...] Could you provide the exact color code or description of the green used in your game area? [...] I think ChatGPT’s limited context window is beginning to cause problems. I don't know but here's the code: #gameArea {    width: 400px; /* Adjust to your game area's size */    height: 400px; /* Adjust to your game area's size */   position: relative;    margin: auto;    background-color: green; /* Solid green background */}
41. New images are not much better. Ada talked about transparency (where is she and Curio?) - can we make the image have transparency?
42. Ada and Curio here! But then the following text doesn’t say who is “talking”. More images with faulty transparency generated. thanks but not better - let's forget this. Ada can you make it so the riddles are read outloud?
43. Good explanation and code generated that speaks the puzzles. great can it speak the response to the user
44. Good explanation and code Thanks! but can we get rid of the messages with the OK button
45. Good explanation and code can the player say their answer?
46. Good explanation and many code changes including updating parts of existing functions. wow that's lots of changes! can you just give me a new version of the whole thing?
47. Generated a new file but some parts were just comments to include the old code. I ignored that. it is broken now - can't move the fairy
48. Some progress but still not generating a complete file. I see things like "// Player movement code remains the same..." - doesn't it need the code? where is it?
49. More complete but still not everything (I guess we are reaching some context and output limits). working except treasures don't appear and the monster doesn't move
50. Provided the missing code and instructions where to put it. wow - it works great! how can the player give up on a riddle? This feature was lost when speech input replaced text.
51. Good response. great - why do I see messages that say this file wants to use the microphone?
52. Nice long explanation. you said it should ask for the first use but it asks every time
53. Explanation and revised code. now it is broken - nothing works - how can we fix it? I knew there was an error message but was pretending I didn’t know how to deal with errors.
54. Generated code that didn’t help. I've heard about "bugs" in programs - can there be one now?
55. Long discussion of errors and debugging. how can I see error messages?
56. Detailed instructions to see the console log (and more debugging ideas that are not relevant just now). Ok. I found this: Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'recognition' has already been declared (at mygame.html:72:13)
57. Suggested fix didn’t remove the redundant declarations. can you see the problem in the code. Here it is: [...]
58. [...] After reviewing your code, I found the issue causing the "Uncaught SyntaxError" error. You have declared the recognition variable twice in your script [...] But then generates code that ignore this. is it ok if I delete "let recognition = null;" ? I was getting tired of this and it did say there shouldn’t be two of these declarations.
59. Yes [...] I see this "mygame.html:89 Uncaught ReferenceError: askRiddle is not defined    at checkInteractionWithMonster (mygame.html:89:17)    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (mygame.html:46:13)"
60. It repeats the askRiddle function. after all that it still asks to use the microphone for each riddle
61. A long technical response. i don't understand any of that but can this be fixed?
62. New code and explanation. no better. and it no longer responds to "give up" by telling the player the answer
63. Responded with code that corrects this. can we display what the player said?
64. New code and explanations. I don't see anything new - should I paste the code in case I did something wrong I think it really was working but there was a several second long period where something (speech code?) was loading when the game starts
65. [...] Once I have the complete code, I can provide more specific guidance to ensure that the feature for displaying the player's spoken response works as intended. I pasted the entire file contents.
66. It identified a function defined twice (but I don’t think that was the problem). great - thanks so much - my game is really cool - maybe I'll come back and want to make it even better - any ideas I should think about?
67. 10 suggestions for further enhancements. thanks - my little brother wants to know how I made the game - what should I say? I wanted to see a summary and made up a context for asking.
68. Very good description. he's asking now how the game works
69. Good answer. someone helped me put my game on the web but now we see this "mygame.html:113 Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'start' on 'SpeechRecognition': recognition has already started.    at checkInteractionWithMonster (https://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/zelda/mygame.html:113:33)    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> https://toontalk.github.io/AI/apps/zelda/mygame.html:47:13)" I hosted the game and encountered this error so I went back to ChatGPT. I think the error doesn’t occur when running on the local file system, maybe because it is always asking for permission and waiting.
70. Code and explanation. now it doesn't listen after the first riddle
71. Code and explanation fixed that.


The entire text I entered while role-playing a middle school student comes to 700 words. The child needs to be able to copy and paste text into a file, placing it where instructed. The child also needs to provide feedback to the chatbot.

don't know what to do


ChatGPT
Curio: That's totally fine! Let's start by thinking about what kind of games you enjoy. Do you like puzzle games, adventure games, or maybe something fast-paced like a racing game?


Ada: Yeah, knowing what types of games you like can give us a good starting point. Also, think about what you want the player to do in your game. Should they solve puzzles, explore a world, or compete against a timer?


Curio: And remember, your game doesn't have to be complicated. Simple games can be really fun and a great way to learn coding.


Ada: Exactly! Once we have a basic idea, we'll start by creating a simple version of the game. Then, we can add more features and improvements over time.


Curio: So, let's brainstorm! What are some of your favorite games, or what's something you think would be cool in a game? Don't worry about how complex it might seem; we'll figure out how to start simple.


User
i like the Zelda games
ChatGPT
Ada: That's great! The "Zelda" series is known for its adventure, exploration, puzzles, and engaging story. We can definitely draw inspiration from that.


Curio: How about we create a simple adventure game where the player explores a small world, collects items, and solves puzzles? We can start with just one room or area.


Ada: Good idea, Curio. We can design a small map, maybe a forest or a dungeon, and the player can move around, interact with objects, and discover secrets.


Curio: What if the player has to find a key to unlock a door, or collect a certain number of items to progress? That could be our first puzzle.


Ada: I like that! And we can keep the controls simple: arrow keys for movement and maybe another key for interactions. What do you think about this idea? Does it sound like something you'd like to try creating?


Curio: Remember, we'll help you with every step, from writing the code to testing the game. And you can always ask questions or share your thoughts.


Ada: Once you're ready, we'll start by setting up the basic structure of the game in HTML and JavaScript. We'll go at your pace and make sure everything is clear.


User
ok
ChatGPT
Ada: Great! Let's start by setting up the basic structure of your adventure game. We'll create a simple HTML file with some JavaScript and CSS to control the game's mechanics and style.


Curio: Can you remind me, Ada, what does each part do?


Ada: Sure, Curio! HTML is like the skeleton of the game. It's where we define the elements like the game area. CSS is like the skin; it makes everything look nice. And JavaScript is the muscles; it makes everything move and react.


Curio: Oh, I see. So, what's the first step?


Ada: First, we'll create the HTML structure. Here's a basic template:


  



Curio: What's next?


Ada: Next, we'll add some CSS to style the game area. Let's make it look like a small room or a section of a forest.


Curio: And after that?


Ada: Then we'll write some JavaScript to allow the player to move around. We'll keep it simple for now: just moving up, down, left, and right within the game area.


Curio: Got it! What should our friend do now?


Ada: You can copy this code into a new file using a text editor like Notepad (on Windows) or TextEdit (on Mac). Save the file with a .html extension, like mygame.html. Then, you can open this file in a web browser to see your game.


Curio: And if something doesn't work or if you have questions, just let us know! We're here to help.


Ada: Once you have the file ready and open in your browser, tell us, and we'll continue with adding movement and interactions. How does that sound?
Adding interactivity to the web page
**Ada:** Fantastic! Now that your game area and player are set up, let's add some interactivity with JavaScript. We'll make it so you can move the player around using the arrow keys on your keyboard.


**Curio:** Oh, that sounds fun! How do we do that?


**Ada:** We'll write some JavaScript code that listens for key presses and moves the player accordingly. Here's the basic idea:


1. **Detect Key Presses**: We need to figure out when the player is pressing an arrow key.
2. **Move the Player**: Based on the key pressed, we'll move the player up, down, left, or right.


Let's start with the JavaScript code. Add this inside the `<script>` tag in your HTML file:


  



**Curio:** This looks a bit complex. Can you break it down for us, Ada?


**Ada:** Of course! Here’s what each part does:


- **Event Listener**: We're listening for when a key is pressed down (`keydown`).
- **Getting the Player**: We select the player element so we can move it.
- **Position Variables**: `top` and `left` keep track of where the player is.
- **Movement Logic**: We change `top` and `left` based on which arrow key is pressed.
- **Updating Position**: We apply the new `top` and `left` values to the player's style, moving it on the screen.


**Curio:** So when I press an arrow key, the blue square should move?


**Ada:** Exactly! Save your changes and refresh the page in your browser. Try pressing the arrow keys and see if the player moves around inside the game area.


**Curio:** This is like bringing the game to life!


**Ada:** Yes! Give it a try, and let us know how it goes. If the player moves as expected, we're on the right track. If something doesn't work, tell us, and we'll help troubleshoot.
Adding a monster riddler to the game
**Ada:** That's great news! It sounds like your existing JavaScript code was already set up correctly to handle the player movement, which is why the fairy started moving without needing to copy the new code.


**Curio:** So, the player's movement was already linked to the fairy image?


**Ada:** Exactly. As long as the `div` ID for the player remained the same and the JavaScript was correctly targeting that `div`, the fairy would respond to the movement commands.


**Curio:** That means they can now explore the game world with their fairy character!


**Ada:** Right. Now that the basic movement and character appearance are set, you can continue building your game. You might want to add more features like obstacles, collectible items, or puzzles.


**Curio:** Oh, and maybe even some sound effects or music!


**Ada:** Indeed! There are many possibilities to expand your game. And remember, if you have any questions or need assistance with adding new features, we're here to help.


**Curio:** Congratulations on getting your fairy character moving in your game. It's a big step in game development! What would you like to work on next?

how about a cute monster that if you answer its riddle you get a treasure
ChatGPT
Ada: That's a fantastic idea! Adding a riddle-solving element with a monster and a treasure can make your game more interactive and fun. We can start by creating the monster and setting up the riddle interaction.


Curio: How do we do that, Ada?


Ada: We'll create a new element for the monster in the HTML and then write some JavaScript to handle the riddle interaction. Let's break it down:


Create the Monster: Add a new div in your HTML for the monster. You can use an image or CSS styling to make it look like a cute monster.


Set Up the Riddle: When the player interacts with the monster (say, by moving to the same location), a prompt appears with the riddle.


Check the Answer: If the player answers correctly, they get the treasure. We can use a simple JavaScript if statement for this.


Here's a basic setup:


HTML (add this to your existing HTML file): [...]


Curio: What if they want to use a different riddle or a different way to display it?


Ada: They can change the text in the prompt and the correct answer in the if statement to whatever they like. They can also style the monster differently or use an image instead of a colored square.


Curio: This sounds like a fun addition to the game!


Ada: Absolutely! Once you've added these elements, save your file and refresh your browser to see the new monster and try solving the riddle. Remember, you can always modify and expand this basic setup to fit your game's theme and style.


Curio: Let us know how it goes or if you have any more ideas or questions! We're here to help with your game development journey.
Adding more riddles

how can we make it have different riddles each time you play?
ChatGPT
Ada: To have different riddles each time you play, you can create an array of riddles in your JavaScript and randomly select one each time the player interacts with the monster. This will make your game more dynamic and interesting.


Curio: How do they set up the array of riddles?


Ada: Here's how you can do it:


Create an Array of Riddles: Define an array in your JavaScript where each element is an object containing a riddle and its answer.


Randomly Select a Riddle: When the player interacts with the monster, randomly select one of these riddles to present.


Here's an example:


  



Curio: What does Math.random() do?


Ada: Math.random() generates a random number between 0 and 1. By multiplying it with the length of the riddles array and using Math.floor(), we select a random index from the array, effectively choosing a random riddle each time.


Curio: So every time the player interacts with the monster, they get a different riddle?


Ada: That's correct! Implement these changes in your JavaScript, save the file, and then refresh your game. Each interaction with the monster should now present a different riddle.


Curio: Give it a try and see how it enhances your game. If you have more questions or ideas, we're here to continue assisting you with your game development!
Adding speech

[...]Ada can you make it so the riddles are read outloud?
ChatGPT
Ada: Absolutely, we can add a feature to your game to read the riddles aloud. This can be achieved using the Web Speech API available in modern web browsers. The API allows us to convert text to speech directly in the browser.


Curio: How does it work?


Ada: We'll use the SpeechSynthesisUtterance interface of the Web Speech API. First, we'll create a function that takes a string of text (the riddle) and speaks it out loud. Here's how you can implement it:


Create a Function to Speak Text: [...]


Curio: Will this work in all browsers?


Ada: The Web Speech API is widely supported in modern browsers, but there might be some variations in how different browsers handle speech synthesis. It's a good idea to test this feature in the browsers you expect your game to be played in.


Curio: Go ahead and add these modifications to your game. This should enable the riddles to be read out loud, making your game more interactive and accessible. If you encounter any issues or have more questions, feel free to ask!

great can it speak the response to the user
ChatGPT
Ada: Certainly! We can modify the code so that the game also speaks the responses to the user, such as confirming a correct answer, indicating a wrong answer, or acknowledging when the player gives up.


Curio: How do we do that?


Ada: We'll use the same speak function that we created for reading the riddles. We'll just call this function with different text based on the player's interaction with the riddle. Here's how you can modify the checkInteractionWithMonster function: [...]


Curio: This way, the game interacts more with the player!


Ada: Yes, it adds an auditory dimension to the game, making it more engaging and accessible, especially for players who might prefer or require auditory feedback.


Curio: Try implementing these changes in your game. This will make the game respond to the player's answers with spoken feedback. If you have any more questions or need assistance, let us know!

thanks - my little brother wants to know how I made the game - what should I say?
ChatGPT
Ada: Explaining to your little brother how you created the game can be a great opportunity to spark his interest in programming and game development. Here's a simple way to describe the process:


Idea and Design: "I started by thinking of what kind of game I wanted to make. I decided on a game where you move a character around and solve riddles. I thought about what it should look like and how it should work."


Writing Code: "I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to write the code for the game. HTML is like the game's structure, where I put all the elements like the player, monster, and treasures. CSS is used to make it look nice, like setting the colors and sizes. JavaScript is like the brain of the game; it makes everything move and respond to what you do, like moving the character with arrow keys and making the game speak and listen to riddles."


Testing and Fixing Problems: "After writing some code, I tested the game to see if it worked. Sometimes things didn’t work right, so I had to find and fix the problems, which are called 'bugs'. It's like being a detective to figure out what's going wrong."


Making it Better: "Once the basic game was working, I added more features to make it more fun, like different riddles, scoring points, and maybe even levels. I kept testing and improving it."


Sharing the Game: "After I was happy with how the game worked, I shared it with others to play. I can even keep making changes to add more cool stuff to the game."


Curio: How can they involve their brother?


Ada: You could show him some of the simpler parts of the code and explain what each part does. Maybe even let him change a few simple things, like colors or sizes, to see the immediate effect of his changes. This hands-on experience can be very exciting and educational.


Curio: It's great to share your passion and knowledge with your brother. Who knows, you might inspire him to start coding and creating games too! If you both have more questions or need help in the future, feel free to ask.

he's asking now how the game works
ChatGPT
Ada: Explaining how the game works to your little brother can be both fun and educational. Here's a simple way to break it down for him:


The Game's World: "The game has its own little world inside the computer. This world is what you see on the screen when you play. It has a green area where our character, the fairy, can move around, and there are other characters like a monster and treasures."


Moving the Character: "You can move the fairy around using the arrow keys on the keyboard. When you press an arrow key, the game's code tells the fairy where to go on the screen."


Interacting with the Monster: "When the fairy gets close to the monster, the game asks you a riddle. I wrote these riddles in the game's code, and the game picks one randomly each time you meet the monster."


Using the Microphone: "If you answer the riddle out loud, the game uses the computer's microphone to hear you. The game can understand what you say and check if your answer is right or wrong."


Finding Treasures: "If you get the riddle right, the game shows a treasure on the screen as a reward. If you don't know the answer and say 'give up,' the game will tell you the right answer and then the monster moves to a new place."


The Game's Rules: "The game follows rules that I wrote in its code. These rules tell the game what to do in different situations, like when to ask a riddle, how to move the monster, and where to put the treasures."


Curio: How can they make it relatable?


Ada: You can relate the game to something he's familiar with, like a board game or a story, but explain that in this game, the computer follows the rules and instructions you've written to decide what happens.


Curio: It's a great way to introduce him to the concept of coding and game development. You can also show him the actual code and point out the simple parts, like where the riddles are written or how the character is moved with the arrow keys. This can help make the connection between the code and what happens in the game. If he's curious to learn more or try coding himself, there are many fun resources and tools available for young learners!
Reflections on this conversation
Looking at the entire conversation we see several occurrences where Ada and Curio discuss how to address the user’s requests. Curio often asks questions that I imagine are the kinds of things that a child might wonder about. The answers often use helpful metaphors but they aren’t always restricted to non-technical child-friendly language.


Ada and Curio guide the child to start very simple and then repeatedly enhance. Often the student enters a vague request and the chatbot responds with a greatly simplified app (e.g. a small square on top of a big square). It is natural for the child to then request the squares look like characters and can move.


Bugs were frequent but most were easily resolved by telling ChatGPT what wasn’t working. Rarely did it need to see error messages (and Ada explained how to find the error messages). The image generation mostly worked well except it was confused about how to make the backgrounds transparent. 


At any point the user can ask questions or request suggestions for what to do next (that I often forgot to do while attempting to simulate a middle school child).


I like the responses to the request to provide explanations to a younger brother - not sure how to make such reflections happen naturally without the child asking for them.


There is a lot to read in many responses. Some children may skim the text. With some engineering effort it would be possible to use speech synthesis to make the conversations between Ada and Curio come to life.
