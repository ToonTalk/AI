From 11 to 16 July 2023 I ran several experiments with the prompt “Create a story that proves <a short description of a theorem> and at the same is a captivating story.” This was inspired by reading poems (including Haikus) and Shakespearian dialogues by ChatGPT that prove there is an infinite number of primes. I then explored similar experiments generating epic poems and series of jokes that explain various proofs.


After the primes, I explored stories about cardinality, incompleteness, halting, Ramanujan summation, showing pi and square of 2 are irrational, 0.9999… = 1, and toruses.  Overall I’m very impressed with how well ChatGPT dealt with these challenges (except it did badly on geometric theorems). I am very disappointed in other LLMs.


These stories, poems, and jokes could be made for students, by students for themselves, or by students for others.
Motivations
Besides curiosity about what the current crop of chatbots can do, I’m interested in how this can be used educationally.


I now think if I was a math teacher I would see how it would go if I gave an assignment like this:


Your task is to get the chatbot to generate a story about the proof that there are an infinite number of primes. Repeatedly provide feedback to both make the story more to your liking and that it integrates and explains the proof well. Also get the chatbot to generate illustrations for the story. Send in the illustrated story AND the link to your conversation with the chatbot.


You can ask the chatbot to check if there are any mathematical mistakes in story drafts it has generated and to rewrite the story if there are some. You can ask the chatbot to make suggestions for how to improve your story.


Inspired by the research of Yasmin Kafai and Idit Harel who explored children making education software and games for younger children, maybe a better assignment is that the student is asked to generate a story for a younger student (maybe with help from another student). The story can be customized by the older student for the interests and background of the younger student. Maybe the older student then interviews the younger student to see her reaction.


If I had to grade such an assignment I would weigh my evaluation of the process (the conversation link) more heavily than the final product. And how much did the whole thing demonstrate an understanding of the underlying mathematics?


I’m currently focussing on mathematics but wonder about other fields.


A made this video demonstrating some of the ideas here.
ChatGPT 4’s stories, poems, jokes, diaries, recipes, murder mysteries, headlines and apps illustrating the infinite number of primes proof
First story and a different one 
I was impressed with my first attempt. (PDF of log) I was curious how it would respond to “Great. Can make another that is very different?”. To my taste it wasn’t quite as good but still very impressive.
Story for a young girl that loves horses (PDF of log)
Story for a young boy who loves robots (PDF of log)
The proof as an epic poem (PDF of log)
Asking for a story for someone who loves poems just produced a pretty good story. Asking for poems to insert into the poem worked well. Then asking it to start again and this time to make an epic poem.
The proof as a series of jokes (PDF of log)
This worked well the first time I tried it “Tell a series of jokes that manage to incorporate a proof for why there is no limit to the number of primes. It should be funny and mathematically accurate.”
The proof as a play
Worked fine the first time but not very creative. Tried several variants. I concluded at the end that it is really really hard to make this understandable for someone who doesn’t understand multiplication or division.
The proof as a baking recipe
I was impressed on the first try.
The proof in the diary of a young girl (PDF of log)
I thought this was pretty good.

Prehistoric girl discovers the proof using pebbles
With my help, I got ChatGPT 4 to generate a story with a solid physical metaphor for prime and composite numbers and their products and divisors. I also asked ChatGPT for illustration prompts and the result (with a small amount of rewording when DALLE-2 or Stable Diffusion produced inappropriate images) is the illustrated version of Ada and the Infinite 'Rock-Lines'  A Prehistoric Tale of Prime Numbers.
An interactive web app for exploring the proof
I then used ChatGPT to create this app that interactively illustrates the proof using the pebbles metaphor. It was a long conversation but my role was to instruct and to copy and paste. I wrote nor edited any of the code (over 200 lines of JavaScript and 150 lines of HTML and CSS). Note that the app could be enhanced to deal better when the product of the accumulated primes plus 1 is composite. It proceeds with a factor that is greater than the largest of the accumulated primes even if the other factor is prime and not in the current list of primes.


I then thought it would be interesting when the app goes to the next number (e.g. 2x3x7+1) that it animates the process. ChatGPT helped a bit but was frequently confused about the names of functions and element ids. Perhaps the context was too large and it wasn’t aware of some of the details of the code it had generated earlier. And it mixed up columns and rows! I got frustrated and ended up editing the code it generated for this extension of the app. Here’s the unpolished version with animation of the product of the known primes plus 1.
Google’s Bard does a very bad job
The conversation
Not only wasn’t it a very good story but there was no proof in it. In response to “The proof itself didn't appear in the story. And be more creative!” the story was a bit better but still no proof. It did include “Alice then explained the proof to the students. It was a simple proof, but it was elegant and it was convincing. The students were amazed by the proof, and they were even more amazed by Alice's explanation.”
Anthropic’s Claude 2 did a bit better than Bard
The conversation
Like Bard it didn’t include a proof in its first attempt and after telling it “But the proof didn't appear in the story” there was a proof but the result was bad. It improved somewhat when asked “Be more creative” but it still wasn’t good.
Attempts to illustrate the stories
The first conversation.
I wondered if ChatGPT with the Python interpreter could generate some abstract illustrations for the story. Due to a copy and paste error I only copied the first story without instructions and it responded with a nice summary. In response to “I meant can you create visual illustrations to add to make it an illustrated story”. It claimed it couldn’t generate the images but came back with about a dozen illustration suggestions that seem OK. I responded with “Can you generate more detailed prompts that can be presented to a generative AI program like DALL-E?” and the responses looked promising. 


But when I tried the first one "A vibrant landscape filled with anthropomorphized numbers living in harmony, representing the realm of Numeria." with DALL-E 2 and SDLX preview from stability.ai it didn’t look like these text-to-image models are able to generate good versions of these suggestions. The best two from DALL-E were very bad (image 1 and image 2). Stable Diffusion was very pretty but wasn’t helpful. ChatGPT wrote “Please note that these are only prompts, and the resulting images may not be exactly as described. It may take a few iterations and tweaking of the prompts to get the desired results.” but I haven’t tried much more.


When asked to rewrite the story based on suggestions from a friend, I got a story that I liked so I then asked for a rewrite for a young child who is very interested in robots. Taking ChatGPT’s suggested illustration prompts to DALLE-2 and Stable Diffusion I created this illustrated version of robot primes story. I found it helped to preface each of ChatGPT’s suggested prompts with “illustration for a children's book that shows …”.


Later I went back to the first generated story and said “Can you rewrite the first version of the story for a young boy who loves robots”. And then asked for illustration prompts. Here’s the extended conversation. Here’s the illustrated version of the first story.


I also asked for illustration prompts but some I needed to edit a bit to generate this illustrated version of Ada and the Infinite 'Rock-Lines'  A Prehistoric Tale of Prime Numbers. 
ChatGPT’s story on Cantor’s theorem on the cardinality of the rational and real number was good
The original conversation
I thought the language was simple and yet conveyed difficult ideas well. I subsequently improved it and added diagrams (using ChatGPT with Code Interpreter). Here is the resulting story with diagrams. Some of the improvements were generated by the process of asking“Are there any mathematical mistakes in the story?” and following that with “Rewrite the story taking into account problem #1” (out of 6 in this case).


Mild success as a series of jokes.
ChatGPT did well on Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem
The conversation
Not bad but odd that everyone was trying to prove the statement that this statement is not provable. In response to “Can you add to the story an intuitive understanding of how one could create something that [the following I quoted from its first story] "stated something about itself in a way that, if true, it would mean it cannot be proven within the mathematical system." it generated a better story that didn’t have this flaw.
Moderate success turning it into a series of jokes
ChatGPT did so so on the Halting problem but recovered when a flaw is pointed out
The conversation
It had the good idea of someone claiming to have solved the halting problem and someone else using a copy of that program tries to break the claimed solution. But then it goes weird with the following that isn’t right:


It was a program designed to execute a copy of AlphaHalting on a different code, which, in turn, would execute another copy of AlphaHalting, thus creating an infinite recursion.


This was the crux of the problem - when Stanley's program tried to analyze this algorithm, it was essentially trying to analyze itself. This recursive scenario created an undecidable condition, and so, AlphaHalting crashed. 


After I had saved the conversation (thereby freezing it) I had an additional exchange that addressed this well:


Me: I like the story but are you sure about the "infinite recursion" being the problem?


ChatGPT
You're right, my apologies for the oversight. Infinite recursion is not the problem per se. Instead, the real issue is the fundamental nature of the Halting problem, which is undecidable.


The Halting problem, as proven by Alan Turing, tells us that there is no general algorithm that can accurately determine whether any arbitrary program (on a Turing machine or any equivalent computational system) halts or not. The reason it's undecidable is not that it might lead to infinite recursion, but because it leads to a paradox, a situation similar to the famous "this statement is a lie" paradox.


The story about AlphaHalting would more accurately hinge on this paradoxical nature of the Halting problem. Stanley Turing would run into an issue where, when trying to determine whether AlphaHalting itself would halt, he encounters the same undecidable problem that his ancestor Alan Turing described. If AlphaHalting says that it will halt, then by contradiction it must not, and vice versa. The paradox is what leads to the program crashing.


Thank you for bringing up the point, and I hope this clarifies things!
With lots of prompting came up with halting problem jokes that get the core idea
Why did the "Halting Problem Solver" leave the Logic Olympics?
As soon as it boasted about solving all the problems, someone asked, "Can you tell us if a program that halts if and only if you say it doesn't halt, actually halts?"


And


How do you make a "Halting Problem Solver" break its New Year's resolution?
Ask it if it can predict whether a program that contradicts its prediction will halt!
Some problems with Ramanujan Summation
The conversation
I gave up trying to get the details right but it got the general idea.
Problems with showing that pi is irrational
The conversation
It explained the question well in the story but kept insisting on the characters relying upon measurement to show it is true (at least it was iteratively refining the measure that I suppose could be done forever in a story). But I gave up when looked at the proof on Wikipedia.
Square root of 2 is irrational
The first conversation, another, and another explain the task well but not the proof. Did well on the fourth attempt.
The proof as a series of jokes
Did OK in my opinion. 


Note that Seymour Papert explored how people approach this proof in  Papert, S. (1978). The Mathematical Unconsciousness. In J. Wechsler (Ed.), On Aesthetics in Science (pp. 105-120). Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press.
0.9999… = 1
Did well the first time. Note that adding “Write it for a young person that loves sports, especially soccer.” well


Llama 2 did poorly on this.
It was hard to get jokes that explained this but easy to get lots of jokes around the concept. 
Same with Llama 2
ei𝜋+1 = 0
Decent story emerged. Then when I asked for details an even better story resulted. But ChatGPT didn’t assemble the pieces well. Here’s the entire story. ChatGPT-3.5 also generated a story but it had much less detail and didn’t convey the underlying intuitions.
Taylor series expansions
Wrapped around screens are toruses, not spheres
Came close to explaining this well but I grew impatient and gave more of a hint (“introduce the idea that the Logo screen is like a flat piece of paper that has been rolled up”) that I should have and the final story was pretty good.
A story about formal grammars
Several attempts at proofs by Euclid
I wasn’t very happy with the results. I guess geometry is not its strong point.
Pythagoras’ Theorem didn’t work so well
ChatGPT 4’s attempts
It started with a story that didn’t work, then a character observes that a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5 when the sides become squares with pebbles that the theorem works out. When I complained about that a character in the story claims her observation works for any right triangle.
I also tried to create a conversation between a critic and writer and the story doesn’t address the intuition. And when presented with a hint it still did poorly. (Link not yet available because asked for an illustration too.)
Bard did a terrible job with Pythagoras’ theorem too.
But Claude 2 does the worst job

There is some overlap with FlatLand , Alice in Wonderland, Hilbert’s Hotel and the stories by LLMs.


I haven’t done a thorough literature review but here’s some things I’ve found


The Number Devil. According to Wikipedia a boy has 12 dreams about prime numbers, roots and powers of numbers, irrational numbers, permutations, infinite sets, golden ratios, and a variety of other things that are somewhat similar to the stories I got LLMs to generate. There are proofs about infinite number of natural numbers and rational numbers and that the cardinality of odd numbers is the same as the natural numbers. While it received some good reviews and sold well in Europe I worry that this reviewer may be right when he wrote that the book “add[s] up to a series of lessons with colourful dialogue rather than something I'd describe as an "adventure". The tale uses the narrative device of a series of dreams for no apparent reason.. ” TES Book of the Week Though Martin Gardner (later of Scientific American fame) wrote glowingly of the book. The New Review of Books has a detailed very positive review.


The Forest of Numbers was written by an undergraduate struggling with the proofs in the course “Fundamentals of Abstract Algebra”.
Literature on the role of stories in learning
I am starting to read articles like The value of storytelling in learning | Wharton Interactive and Roger Schank’s Tell me a story: A new look at real and artificial memory. The idea that stories can play an important role in learning is an idea that has been around for millenia.
