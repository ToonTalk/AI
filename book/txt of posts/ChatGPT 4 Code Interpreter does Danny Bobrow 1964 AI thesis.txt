ChatGPT 4 Code Interpreter does Danny Bobrow’s AI thesis


Ken Kahn <toontalk@gmail.com>


On 10 July 2023  I uploaded Danny’s thesis Natural Language Input for a Computer Problem Solving System (1964). I then asked ChatGPT 4 with the Python Code Interpreter enabled “The thesis I uploaded has several math word problems. Extract each one and solve them.” The entire conversation is here.


After informing me that it can’t read PostScript files I tried again with the PDF. But it tried to convert it to text but it was a collection of images. It tried to OCR it but didn’t have enough memory so it suggested I just provide images of the problems. It would have been interesting if it would have extracted all the word problems automatically.
The only troublesome problem
There was only one problem that it got wrong (as did I). 


"MARY IS TWICE AS OLD AS ANN WAS WHEN MARY WAS AS OLD AS ANN IS NOW. IF MARY IS 24 YEARS OLD, HOW OLD IS ANN?"

A problem STUDENT lacked some common sense knowledge it needed that ChatGPT had


  

  

ChatGPT responded to this with
  

A problem STUDENT couldn’t solve.


But STUDENT couldn’t handle quadratic equations. But at least it knew that it couldn’t.
  

ChatGPT solved - and explained - this well.
  

ChatGPT’s only mistake
"MARY IS TWICE AS OLD AS ANN WAS WHEN MARY WAS AS OLD AS ANN IS NOW. IF MARY IS 24 YEARS OLD, HOW OLD IS ANN?"
  



So I wrote “Are you sure?” and it repeated the incorrect reasoning. 


But when I wrote ‘But it says "Ann WAS"’ it correctly responded:


  



Marvin Minsky wrote about Danny’s STUDENT program and this problem in Scientific American


When, for instance, it meets a statement such as "Mary is twice as old as Ann was when Mary was as old as Ann is now," the program knows how to make the meaning of "was when" more precise by rewriting the statement as two simple sentences: "Mary is twice as old as Ann was X years ago. X years ago Mary was as old as Ann is now.


Minsky, Marvin L. “ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.” Scientific American 215, no. 3 (1966): 246–63. 


And Danny wrote in his thesis
  



When I tried ChatGPT 4 without the Code Interpreter it did well. Perhaps its training included this problem. Maybe just luck.
