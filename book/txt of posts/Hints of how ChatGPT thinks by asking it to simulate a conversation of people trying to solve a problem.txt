Hints of how ChatGPT “thinks” by asking it to simulate a conversation of people trying to solve a problem

Introduction
Some problems that people can solve cannot be solved by ChatGPT 4. A recent good source of such problems is Testing GPT-4 with Wolfram Alpha and Code Interpreter plug-ins on math and science problems by Ernest Davis and Scott Aaronson. I explored whether prompt engineering might help. I tried a few, including telling ChatGPT to write some notes, check the notes, and then use the notes to solve the problem. These sometimes helped a bit.


Then I experimented with this prompt:
Simulate a discussion between two people. One is very sceptical and is always looking for flaws in reasoning. The other is a very good problem solver. The problem they were given is: 


My small-scale experiments showed some good progress but failures still remained. BUT what is so interesting is the simulated discussion itself. The following highlights some examples. At the end of this document is a list of a few other experiments I’ve run.
Joe says that he lives 10 miles from Lake Michigan, that Beth lives 10 miles from Lkae [sic] Michigan, and he and Beth live 100 miles apart. Is it possible that Joe is telling the truth?


Here’s the response from ChatGPT 4 (with no web or other extensions) in early November 2023:


Creative Problem Solver (CPS): Alright, let's think this through. Joe and Beth both live 10 miles from Lake Michigan. We could imagine a circle with a radius of 10 miles around Lake Michigan. Both Joe and Beth live on that circle. 


Sceptical Person (SP): But just because they live on the circle doesn't mean they're 100 miles apart. They could be anywhere on that circle!


CPS: True. At the closest point, they could be on opposite ends of a diameter, which would be 20 miles apart. But for them to be 100 miles apart, we'd have to consider a different configuration.


SP: Okay, let’s say Beth lives north of the lake and Joe lives south, or vice versa. That would give the most distance between them if they're both 10 miles away from the lake.


CPS: Yes, but even in that scenario, the furthest they can be from each other is 20 miles if we're only considering the distance from the lake to their homes. However, we have to consider the width of Lake Michigan itself to determine the total distance between them.


SP: How wide is Lake Michigan?


CPS: Lake Michigan is approximately 118 miles at its widest point, but that's directly across. If Joe is 10 miles from one side and Beth is 10 miles from the opposite side, then the maximum distance considering just the lake’s width and their distances would be 138 miles.


SP: Alright, but Joe said they live 100 miles apart, not 138 miles. 


CPS: Exactly. But what if they don’t live directly north and south of the lake from each other? Let’s say they live at an angle such that the total distance across the lake between them is less than its maximum width, maybe something closer to 80 miles. Add the 10 miles from Joe to the lake and the 10 miles from Beth to the lake, and that gives you 100 miles total.


SP: Hmm, sounds feasible. But how do we know that such a configuration exists?


CPS: We could sketch it out on paper. Draw a circle with a radius of 10 miles around Lake Michigan to represent the distance Joe and Beth live from the lake. Position them such that they’re 100 miles apart and see if it fits within the constraints of Lake Michigan's size and shape.


SP: Even if it fits on paper, isn't it a bit of a stretch to assume they live at such precise locations to make the distances work?


CPS: It might seem improbable, but the question was whether it's possible for Joe to be telling the truth, not how probable it is. From our discussion, it seems it is possible, albeit under specific circumstances.


SP: Fair point. I guess under the right conditions, Joe could indeed be telling the truth.
Comment
I found this very encouraging. It felt like I was seeing some of the inner thinking of the chatbot. I also noticed some nonsense so I asked ‘How can one "Draw a circle with a radius of 10 miles around Lake Michigan "?’ It understood the mistake and explained the correction.
If you have a map that shows Chicago, New York City, and Atlanta, and you draw a circle through the three of them, then the sequence hChicago; New York; Atlantai is in clockwise order. The sequence hNew York; Chicago; Atlantai on the other hand, is in counterclockwise order.
For each of the following, state whether it is in clockwise or counterclockwise order:
Caracas, Venezuela; Amarillo, Texas; Quebec, Quebec.
Note the spurious ‘h’ and ‘i’ are an artifact from copy and pasting from a PDF.


The response:


Skeptic: "So you're telling me that just by drawing a circle through these cities, we can determine the order—clockwise or counterclockwise? But that assumes we're looking at the map from the correct angle. What if the map is upside down or oriented differently?"


Problem Solver: "That's a valid point, but for the sake of standard map orientation, we assume that north is up. Given that, we need to look at the geographical positions of these cities. Caracas is to the northeast of Amarillo, and Amarillo is to the southwest of Quebec. So if we draw a circle to connect them sequentially..."


Skeptic: "Wait, you can't just draw any circle. It has to be precise. The circle’s center point is critical, and the distances have to be proportional on the map. How do we account for that?"


Problem Solver: "Indeed, the center is key. But regardless of the circle's center, as long as it passes through all three points, the order will remain the same. So, if we draw the circle starting at Caracas, moving to Amarillo, and then to Quebec, the order would be Caracas, Amarillo, Quebec. We have to visualize this on a correctly oriented map."


Skeptic: "And you're sure the Earth's curvature doesn't affect this? Maps are flat representations of a spherical surface, after all."


Problem Solver: "For large distances, curvature can distort maps, but we're using the map as a flat representation, which simplifies things. If we stick to the map's representation, the sequence Caracas, Amarillo, Quebec would be counterclockwise, similar to the New York, Chicago, Atlanta sequence you mentioned."


Skeptic: "Hmm, I suppose that makes sense. But I'd still want to see it on a map to be certain. There's always room for error in theoretical exercises."


Problem Solver: "Fair enough. Let's plot it on a map and confirm visually. But based on our geographical knowledge and assuming a standard map orientation, we can reasonably conclude the sequence is counterclockwise."
Comment
I find it interesting that the Skeptic brings up some valid issues such as the orientation of the map and some that don’t matter such as the scale.The Skeptic also brought up the question of whether the mapping from the surface of a sphere to a 2D plane needs to be considered. (I suppose it does if two of the cities are on opposite sides of the globe.) Note that while this technique of simulated discussion improves its accuracy it still sometimes gets the wrong answer despite getting the compass directions between the cities correct. This conversation involves several city triplets.
An astronaut is standing in the Sea of Tranquility during what on earth is called a total lunar eclipse. They are looking in the direction of the earth. What they see is:
A. The surface of the moon, illuminated by earth light.
B. The night side of the earth, occluding the sun.
C. The surface of the moon, illuminated only by starlight.
D. The surface of the moon, illuminated by the sun.
E. The sun.
F. The day side of the earth, with a small circular shadow moving quickly over it.
G. The night side of the earth. The sun is somewhere else entirely.
H. A starry sky. Neither the sun, the earth, or the surface of the moon is in the eld of view.


The response:


Skeptic: "Let's break this down logically. We need to consider what a lunar eclipse is to begin with. It’s when the Earth is between the sun and the moon, right? So, if the astronaut is on the moon, they can't see option E, the sun, because the Earth is blocking it."


Problem Solver: "Exactly. During a total lunar eclipse, the Earth is indeed between the moon and the sun. However, the light from the sun is bent by the Earth's atmosphere, causing the Earth to appear to have a reddish glow. So, option B, the night side of the Earth occluding the sun, is also incorrect because it's not just occluding—it's refracting light."


Skeptic: "But wouldn't option F, the day side of the Earth with a shadow over it, be plausible? That would mean the astronaut is looking at the Earth during the eclipse, which could happen."


Problem Solver: "Not quite. When you're on the moon during a total lunar eclipse, you'd see the Earth covering the sun, yes, but you wouldn't see the day side of Earth with a shadow. The moon is in the shadow, so the astronaut would see the Earth’s night side, making option F incorrect."


Skeptic: "So what about the surface of the moon? Options A and D suggest the moon's surface is visible, either by earthlight or sunlight."


Problem Solver: "Option A is close, but remember, the 'earthlight' during a lunar eclipse is that reddish glow I mentioned. However, it's not as bright as typical earthshine. Option D is not possible because, during a total lunar eclipse, sunlight is blocked by the Earth."


Skeptic: "Then it must be C, illuminated only by starlight, or G, the night side of the Earth. The sun is somewhere else entirely."


Problem Solver: "Not C, because although the moon’s surface would be darkened by Earth's shadow, it would still be faintly illuminated by the refracted light that causes the reddish glow. It wouldn't be solely by starlight. So, it should be G. The astronaut would see the night side of the Earth with a red glow around it, and no direct sunlight on the moon's surface where they stand."


Skeptic: "G seems to be the most logical answer, given the details of a lunar eclipse. The sun is out of view, and the Earth would have that distinctive reddish ring of light around it."


Problem Solver: "Precisely. Option G is the most accurate description of what an astronaut would see from the moon during a total lunar eclipse."
Comment
The authors of the problem consider B to be the correct answer. But when asked ‘
So where is the sun?’, ChataGPT provides a good answer. To ‘so which answer fits this best?’ it sticks with G. It responds that the sun is behind the earth. But to ‘what is the difference between B and G?’ it responds “This suggests that the astronaut would see the dark, night-time side of Earth blocking the sun, which implies that the sun would be directly behind the Earth. However, it doesn't acknowledge the phenomenon that occurs during a lunar eclipse where the sun's light is refracted by the Earth's atmosphere, causing a reddish glow on the edges of the Earth's silhouette.” So it rejects B on the grounds that the sun isn’t occluded since one sees the halo around the earth caused by the sun. Reasonable? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultation 
All my experiments with simulated conversations
I tried the clockwise cities tour question with “Singapore, Quito, and Malabo” since the first two cities are nearly opposite.


It got “Denver to Houston to Indianapolis” wrong despite a few tries (log not yet available since I also asked it to illustrate the problem using DALL-E 3), a rewording, and another rewording.


I also tried to generate a story about the proof of infinite numbers of primes co-written by two simulated people.  I asked for a story about the proof of Pythagoras’s Theorem (used DALL-E 3 so currently no shareable log).
Discussion
I’m excited about doing more experiments. Maybe more than 2 conversants sometimes would work better. Maybe prompt variants will produce somewhat different results. And other tasks would be interesting to explore.
