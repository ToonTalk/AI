Summary (generated by ChatGPT 4)
When I asked ChatGPT to summarize this document the following resulted:


The author explored the relationship between weather patterns and influenza cases using machine learning, particularly TensorFlow models. With assistance from ChatGPT 4, they developed a web-based tool that sources weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and influenza data from the US CDC, focusing on Chicago. After addressing various challenges in data acquisition, parsing, and merging, they succeeded in creating an application that allows users to upload CSV data and generate predictions on influenza incidence based on weather conditions.


The author worked on an app that uses TensorFlow.js to predict the total number of influenza patients based on weather data. They utilized ChatGPT for assistance in defining and training a predictive model. The model employed an LSTM structure with training data sequences predicting the following week's 'TOTAL PATIENTS'. There were initial challenges with data preprocessing, missing values, and erroneous columns which required multiple interactions with ChatGPT. Additionally, there were issues of overfitting and the accuracy of the model's predictions. The app was enhanced to include features like displaying training progress, a table of predicted vs. actual values, and the ability to save and load trained models. Despite addressing various bugs and enhancing the app's interface, there were still discrepancies between the predicted and actual values. The author concluded with a graph visualizing this difference and pondered over potential causes for the disparity. They also provided access to the developed app and the processed data file.


The developer shifted focus from predicting absolute patient numbers to evaluating if patient counts would be above or below the weekly average. While updating the app with ChatGPT, several discrepancies and issues arose, like incorrect data metrics and issues in model complexity. The user then sought to evaluate the model’s performance, visualizing training losses and prediction errors. To enhance the visualization, color-coded distinctions were integrated. Although the model's predictions weren't as accurate as hoped, the process took roughly 6 hours and 15 minutes, excluding time spent on data collection. The user reflected on the efficiency of ChatGPT, its capabilities in aiding machine learning and JavaScript novices, and its potential as a collaborative tool in educational settings.


After reflecting on the experiments and writing his documentation, the author considered the possibility that the data might be the root issue in predicting influenza cases based on weather conditions. Upon consulting ChatGPT, an in-depth analysis revealed correlations between weather elements (like temperature and precipitation) and patient counts. However, a significant spike in patient numbers in 2020, aligning with the global outbreak of COVID-19, skewed the data. ChatGPT indicated that this external factor likely had a more substantial impact than weather conditions. When the author opted to focus on data from 2010 to 2019, excluding the pandemic's influence, the model's accuracy significantly improved, highlighting the importance of thorough data analysis before model training.
For your amusement: The summary rewritten in metaphorical language
I asked ChatGPT “Rewrite the following to use as many metaphors, preferrable creative novel ones, as possible.” and presented the summary above. Here’s the result:


The author, like a seasoned sailor navigating the vast ocean of data, embarked on a journey to decipher the cryptic dance between weather rhythms and influenza's ebb and flow using the magical compass of machine learning, specifically the TensorFlow spellbook. With the wise oracle, ChatGPT 4, whispering secrets into their ear, they forged a digital looking glass that peered into the scrolls of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the ancient tomes of the US CDC, with a keen eye on the windy city of Chicago. Battling data dragons, untangling webs of information, and merging scattered puzzle pieces, they unveiled a portal where mortals could feed in CSV scrolls and gaze into the future of influenza's reign based on the whims of the weather.


In a parallel realm, the author, like an alchemist, brewed an elixir using TensorFlow.js to glimpse the gathering storm of influenza patients, guided by the weather's whispers. With ChatGPT as their trusty spellbook, they sculpted a predictive crystal ball. This seer's stone was carved with LSTM runes, with each sequence foretelling the next week's 'GATHERING OF PATIENTS'. Navigating through the fog of data mazes, vanishing trails, and deceptive paths required many a consultation with the ChatGPT oracle. Even as the crystal ball shimmered with features like the tapestry of training progress, a table of foreseen vs. realized events, and the charm to save and recall visions, shadows of doubt lingered. The seer's stone sometimes blurred the lines between prophecy and reality. The author, in the end, painted a starry night of these differences, pondering the mysteries of the universe. They also opened a portal for fellow travelers to experience the magic and peruse the refined scrolls.


The developer, like a bard changing his tune, shifted from singing tales of exact patient counts to ballads of highs and lows compared to the weekly chorus. As they strummed the strings of the app with ChatGPT, a few discordant notes emerged, like jumbled tales and intricate spells gone awry. The bard then painted a vivid tapestry of the model's tales, using a palette of colors to distinguish the highs and lows. Though the song wasn't pitch-perfect, the concert lasted a mere 6 hours and 15 minutes, not counting the time spent gathering tales. The bard sang praises of ChatGPT, its magic for novices in the arts of machine learning and JavaScript spells, and its potential as a muse in halls of learning.


After a period of introspection, akin to a philosopher under a starlit sky, the author pondered if the very fabric of data might be weaving a different tale in predicting influenza's dance with the weather's waltz. Upon seeking wisdom from the ChatGPT oracle, a deep dive into the cosmic pool revealed the ties between weather spirits like temperature and rain and the congregation of patients. Yet, a comet named COVID-19 in 2020 streaked across the sky, casting shadows on the data landscape. ChatGPT whispered that this celestial event might have cast a more profound spell than the weather's song. When the author chose to dance only to tunes from 2010 to 2019, leaving out the comet's trail, the crystal ball's visions grew clearer, underscoring the sacred ritual of data divination before spell casting.
Introduction
Several years ago I wondered if a machine learning program can find a connection between recent weather and subsequent influenza cases. Maybe in bad weather people are inside more often and transmission is easier. I had recently created Snap! blocks for defining, training, and evaluating TensorFlow models. So I tried to use the blocks to explore this idea. The results were initially disappointing and a good deal of effort went into data wrangling. However, after ChatGPT analyzed the data, I noticed a problem. Once fixed, it led to strong results.


Note that my goal was not to make a good predictor of future influenza cases. I did not, for example, ask ChatGPT to include in the training data recent influenza case numbers which others have shown to enable the training of good predictors.


I decided to revisit this using the July 20 and August 3, 2023 versions of ChatGPT 4. I decided to stick with a web-based solution for ease of sharing and because it offers an easy route for others to follow. No installation is required, as all modern browsers can run the app. The first part of the conversation is here.
Starting prompt:
Here is the prompt I started with:


I want to create a web page without relying upon a server to explore whether the weather in an area might affect the incidence of influenza in the same region some days or weeks later. My idea is to load some open data sources for the weather and influenza occurrences, turn the data into differences from the mean of the same data from other years for the same time period. Then I would like to use TensorFlow to create, train, and evaluate predictive models. What would be a good plan to proceed?


This resulted in a good eight point plan. Asking “Can you generate code for step 1?” resulted in a script for fetching data from unspecified weather and influenza APIs.
Loading and parsing the datasets
The response to “Can you find a weatherDataURL and a influenzaDataURL that is freely available for the same region and time period?” resulted in links and descriptions of the relevant data at The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the US CDC.


I decided to focus on a particular region and asked “How can I use those two sources to find data for Chicago?”. The response provided details of how to use the sites for this project. It also pointed out two problems: (1) the weather data is daily and (2) the influenza data is weekly and aggregated at the region level. It suggested Region 5 which includes Chicago.


I then asked “If I go with Region 5 what cities from NOAA should I download data from in order to cover at least half of the population?”. It listed the largest city in each of the six states of Region 5. 


I went to the CDC page ChatGPT suggested, but it wasn’t very helpful. So I entered “On the CDC page I see I can select a year and week and then I see a web page without lots of information but I don't see how to get a CSS file, ideally for the whole year for each of the weeks”. I received detailed instructions though ChatGPT seemed to think the data would be organized around seasons instead of weeks. 


I also discovered that the influenza data was available at the state level so I asked “Good. I can choose to download the data from a selected state. Which state has the fewest cities that make up at least 50% of the total population?” I was thinking that if the city level data covered most of the state population it would be good enough. It suggested New York and Illinois, so I stuck with Chicago.


So I downloaded the datasets and asked “OK. What should I put in the index.html that will load the JavaScript you provided. It should contain a brief description of the goals of the app. The weather file is chicago_weather_weekly.csv and the flu is illinois flu.csv”. It produced a barebones HTML file and when I tried it I got an error. After telling ChatGPT about it, it responded that the problem was a violation of the browser’s CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies. It suggested that the web page simply load the local CSV files. (This worked fine but it demands of the user a few extra mouse clicks and a file path selection.)


Further testing revealed a problem that the generated JavaScript was only able to load a single file. When presented with this issue ChatGPT generated new JavaScript and HTML to address this. However, the JavaScript made use of the Papa Parse library without actually loading it. The URL for the library it suggested in the fix was invalid (maybe it was fine when its training data ended in September 2021) so I found the correct URL myself.


To be sure the files were loaded and parsed correctly I asked “Can we have it display the first few rows of data in a nice table?” It generated code to do so.
Converting data from daily to weekly
I knew I needed weekly weather data and could have proceeded to get ChatGPT to generate JavaScript to aggregate the daily data by weeks but decided to try instead to use ChatGPT with the Python interpreter integrated. Here’s the conversation. I started by uploading the Chicago weather dataset and entering “convert to a weekly dataset where each data item is the average of the values from each day of the week.”. Its response was a link to the new dataset (though clicking “Show work” shows it internally had some errors that it dealt with).
Merging the datasets
I could have continued to use the version of ChatGPT with Python, but instead asked for JavaScript to merge the two datasets. Merging the datasets is non-trivial, as one dataset has a DATE field and the other has both a YEAR and a WEEK number field. It didn’t succeed in creating a merged dataset until I suggested “You can calculate the year from the DATE field”. ChatGPT generated good but buggy code for merging and I had to report problems a few times before it got it right.


I then asked for the app to generate a link for downloading the merged dataset. All seemed to work so I used the app to merge a much bigger weather dataset (14 years instead of 2). The app broke. When I copied the error message to ChatGPT it correctly diagnosed the problem “
It looks like there's an error occurring when attempting to merge the datasets, possibly due to the flu data not being fully loaded at the point of merging.” and fixed it.
The resulting app
Here is the app. If you want to test it here is the weather and influenza datasets I used.
Machine learning prompt
I started a new conversation with ChatGPT with the following prompt. I thought that the description of the dataset fields that was generated in the conversation with ChatGPT with Python might be helpful to include. I also included the description of the third step in the overall plan ChatGPT generated in the beginning (“3. Modeling: Define and train…”).


I want to create a web page without relying upon a server to explore whether the weather in an area might affect the incidence of influenza in the same region some days or weeks later.


I have a csv file which contains weekly data for the weather:
- PRCP: The average precipitation for the week
- SNOW: The average snowfall for the week
- TAVG: The average temperature for the week (this column seems to be NaN, possibly because the original data was missing these values)
- TMAX: The average maximum temperature for the week 
- TMIN: The average minimum temperature for the week


For the flu there are two useful columns:
* TOTAL PATIENTS
* RATIO (which is TOTAL PATIENTS divided by the average number of patients for that month)


Define and train a predictive model using TensorFlow.js. This could be a time-series prediction model that takes into account the weather conditions and predicts the influenza incidence. 


I want the app to allow the user to select the CSV file to load and then either load or generate a predictive model.


It responded with a plan involving data preprocessing, model definition, and web app interface. It remarks that TAVG containing invalid data needs to be addressed. (This problem was noted by the instance of ChatGPT with Python while processing the data.)
Preprocessing the datasets
It suggests the missing TAVG (average temperature) problem could be fixed by averaging the TMAX and TMIN values (daily minimum and maximum temperature). And also that all the values should be standardized to values between 0 and 1. This is to improve the model training process. ChatGPT generated HTML and JavaScript to accomplish this.
Defining and training the model
The app we are building had the comment “// TODO: Define and train the predictive model using TensorFlow.js” so I asked ChatGPT to do this now. It suggested we use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as it is “often used for this kind of task”. It generated the JavaScript and described the code as


This code defines an LSTM model with two LSTM layers and two dropout layers for regularization, followed by a dense layer for output. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function, which is a common choice for regression tasks.


The training data is prepared by creating sequences of length 10 from the dataset. Each sequence is used to predict the 'TOTAL PATIENTS' value of the next week. The sequences and targets are converted to TensorFlow.js tensors, which can be used to train the model.


It looked fine but I suggested “Could we split the data into training and validation?”. It generates the needed code and replies “Absolutely, splitting the data into training and validation sets is a good practice in machine learning…”. Don’t know why it didn’t suggest it earlier.


When I ran it there were errors that I pasted into the chat. It diagnosed the problems. Then I pasted the entire source code into the chat. It corrected the code and responded “Here's the corrected version of your code:”. Amusingly, it had forgotten that the code was its own, not mine.


The next error was due to including in the training data columns that weren’t needed or expected.
More data wrangling of the weather data
I could have fixed things using a spreadsheet program but instead I returned to the conversation with the version of ChatGPT that can use Python internally and requested “Remove the REGION and ILITOTAL columns. And for missing TAVG let's use the after [sic - I meant ‘average’] of the TMAX and TMIN”. Inspecting the resulting spreadsheet I saw empty rows at the end of each year so I entered “Remove rows that only contain a date”.
Training continued
I then went back to the process of generating JavaScript and wrote “OK. I preprocessed the TAVG column so no longer any need to fix that. For now we can ignore the YEAR, WEEK, and RATIO columns”. It updated appropriate code but neglected to remove the now obsolete TAVG processing. I pointed that out and ChatGPT removed it.


Next I pointed out that the log contains many instances of “loss = NaN, val_loss = NaN”. (NaN is JavaScript for “not a number”.) It suggested possible causes being bad data. It updated the preprocessing function to report bad values to the console. There were problems with PRCP (precipitation) and SNOW. I suggested we replace the missing values with 0. ChatGPT updated the preprocessing step accordingly.


The model was now being trained successfully but the only info about how that went was in the console logs. So I asked “Can we show the user the training progress in addition to the console messages?”. It misunderstood my intent and added something to the interface that showed what percentage of the training has been done.
Evaluating the trained model
Loading the dataset was taking too much time (mysteriously between 30 and 300 seconds). I later discovered that running the app in a new tab brought it back to 30 seconds. Instead of loading time, I mistakenly thought that maybe the preprocessing was taking too much time so I asked “Can we after preprocessing display a link for downloading the preprocessed data and change the interface to enable the loading of either the unprocessed or the processed dataset?”. I thought we would only need to do the preprocessing once. But this didn’t help speed up the pre-training phase and just complicated the interface and the code.


I asked “Can the training progess [sic] also include the losses? And is there a way to display accuracy?”. It updated the feedback with the losses. It also provided a long explanation as to why accuracy isn’t appropriate in this context.


After an interaction to improve the look of the app’s interface, I asked “Is this OK? Training progress: 100.00% (loss: 0.02, val_loss: 0.16)”. It suggested we may be overfitting and provided an explanation and some reasonable suggestions. 


I then asked for it to display a table of predicted and real values. It did so but the values were all between 0 and 1. It mentioned that “If you want to display the predictions in the original scale, you would need to apply the reverse transformation (i.e., "unstandardize" the data). To do this, you would need to save the minimum and maximum values for the 'TOTAL PATIENTS' column when you standardize the data, and then use these values to unstandardize the predictions.” I asked it to do the reverse transformation and it updated the code to save the minimum and maximum values used in the standardization and then updated the app to display the original total number of patients each week and the predicted value.


Instead of training the model every time, I suggested “Let's have a way to save a trained model and optionally load it instead of training again.” It replied the easiest way to do this was to save the model in the browser’s memory but that downloading as a file could be done instead.


When I tried to use a saved model errors resulted. The problem was an issue of variable scoping and ChatGPT suggested making the ‘model’ variable global which fixed the problem. Then the same problem and fix occurred for ‘columnStats’. A bit later it happened again with two other variables.


If the user loaded a saved model, it then went ahead, redefined it, and began training. When I pointed out the problem, ChatGPT fixed the problem by introducing a ‘modelLoaded’ variable and using it to skip model definition and training if it is true.


I then complained that it was displaying the number of patients to 2 decimal places. It fixed this by rounding to the nearest integer.


I then asked “How can we also produce a graph of the predicted and actual values” and it produced a nice graph. Looking at the graph I asked “Why might the predicted values be always much lower than the actual?” I replied by describing six possible reasons.
App for predicting the total number of patients
Here is the app. Here is the merged and processed data file to test it.
Switching to predicting the ratio of total patients to the weekly average
I then stopped working on the app that predicted the number of patients and instead focused on predicting if the patient count will be greater or less than “normal” (where normal is approximated as the average value for that month across the entire dataset). I had used ChatGPT with Python to compute this earlier.


It updated the code but I noticed that now one of the training data for the relative number of patients was the absolute number of patients. Not good. So I told ChatGPT this and it fixed it. It didn't rewrite the 'makePredictions' function automatically, so I provided its definition and asked for guidance on how to modify it. It suggested good code changes but neglected to simplify and update other parts. When I pointed this out it fixed the function.


I then noticed that there was a general increase in the number of patients over the 14 years of data. (I don’t know why.) But since the validation dataset was the last 20% of the data I suggested “Let's make the validation data a random sample”. It did so and the results were much better but still bad.
Evaluation measures
I then suggested “I would like to see how often the predicted ratio correctly predicts that the real value will be greater or less than one. And when predicting within 5% of 1 the actual is also within 5% of 1”. This wasn’t very good. I made a series of suggestions for a better test, and ChatGPT implemented them.
A better model
I then suggested “Let's try a deeper bigger model.” It responded with larger layers and an additional layer. Trying it I wondered “Why are the predicted values nearly always below 1”. It provided six possible explanations.


I then copied the training losses log to ChatGPT and asked “Given the following training history do you recommend more epochs, a different learning rate, both, or something else.” It replied “Based on your training history, the model doesn't seem to be overfitting, as the validation loss is comparable to the training loss. However, the model doesn't appear to be learning much after the first few epochs, as the loss doesn't decrease substantially after that point.” and provided a list of suggestions: increase model complexity, change learning rate, train for more epochs, feature engineering, and regularization. It ended by saying “Remember, machine learning involves a lot of trial and error. It can take several attempts to find the architecture and hyperparameters that work best for your specific dataset.”


I then asked how to increase the model complexity. It provided three suggestions and I copied all three into the source code. (Training time increased from two minutes to twelve minutes as a consequence.)


It then wanted to explore some different parameters and asked to change them from constants in the code to page elements that the user can specify. It only completed half the task, so I prompted it further by saying “It isn't clear where to use sequenceLength and tolerance.” It fixed some places that needed updating but forgot one that was causing errors. It implemented a hardcoded solution, which I addressed by suggesting “Instead of [6, 5] isn't [sequenceLength, 5] better?”


A few more exchanges to fix bugs ensued and I was able to experiment with the new version. I then copied the table of predicted and actual values and asked “Why might the predictions have much less variance than the actual values.” Five possible causes were then described.
Visualizing the training losses and prediction errors
I then asked “Can we add a graph of the losses.” It suggested the code to do so that worked first time. 


I then asked “In the table of predicted and real values can be [sic - meant to type ‘we’] make the numbers colored so that they are greener if they are close and redder if they are far apart. And the week number should be blue if predicted and actual are both less than one or greater than one. Otherwise orange.” I then asked “Why are some numbers yellow?” It explained it and wrote “If you don't want any values to be colored yellow, you can simply change the conditions or remove the corresponding lines of code.” I changed yellow to brown since yellow was very hard to read.
Returning to model evaluation
After a back and forth about how we are measuring how well the model is doing we came up with a better one.
The app for predicting the relative number of patients
Here is the final app.
How long did all this take?
1. 40 minutes. Getting the plan of action and suggestions for dataset gathering
2. 50 minutes. Making the app for merging the datasets
3. 6 minutes. Converting the weather dataset to weekly aggregated data
4. 6 minutes. Merging the weather and influenza datasets
5. 150 minutes. Defining, training, and evaluating a model to predict total patient numbers
6. 16 minutes. Switching from absolute to relative patient case numbers
7. 55 minutes. Adding evaluations and visualizations to the app
8. 3 minutes. Making the model bigger
9. 11 minutes. Making it even bigger and testing it
10. 8 minutes. Adding and testing more parameter controls to the interface
11. 7 minutes. Adding a graph of the losses
12. 20 minutes. Implementing and exploring a variety of evaluation measures


In total, the project took about 6 hours and 15 minutes. I haven't included the time spent obtaining datasets from the NOAA and CDC sites. This would have been about 15 minutes but the NOAA site demanded that I obtain 7 datasets with two years of data each and then I had to combine them. This maybe added at most half an hour to the project.
Reflections
The model did a poor job of predicting influenza cases. I didn’t know if the problem is the data, the processing and merging of the data, the model architecture, the training, or that the weather barely influences subsequent influenza case numbers. Then after writing this document I decided to ask ChatGPT for help analyzing the data and it led to good results.


I thought maybe if the model is the problem that a transformer might do a better job. ChatGPT claimed correctly that TensorFlow.js doesn’t have support for transformers and offered Python code and suggested after training the model in Python that we convert it so it can be loaded into TensorFlow.js.


While I have been programming JavaScript and using TensorFlow.js for many years, I strove to interact with ChatGPT as if I were someone without these skills. I refrained from writing any code or fixing any bugs and tried to get ChatGPT’s help without providing it with more information than an inexperienced user might. Overall, I was very impressed by how well ChatGPT 4 did.


I tried to interact with ChatGPT in a natural way and it nearly always understood my intent. I rarely brought up more than one problem at a time (and when I did it sometimes ignored one of them). I also noticed when its responses indicated that it was losing the context (i.e. forgetting what we had done earlier) and I addressed this by copying and pasting code fragments (or sometimes the entire source code) into the chat. Clearly this would rarely happen with a chatbot with a larger context (there is a version of GPT 4 with 4 times the context and Claude has 12 times).


I didn’t bother to polish the apps. In previous experiments just asking ChatGPT to add CSS improved things significantly. Also based on previous experiences, the graphing could be updated in real-time rather than displayed when the training has finished. Also some of the features I requested I later dropped but didn’t ask ChatGPT to remove the dead code.


I have mentored several high school students, who were above average, during summer computational projects that spanned several weeks. Based on my experiences, I think it likely that those students could have done everything I’ve presented here even if they knew nearly nothing about machine learning and JavaScript. ChatGPT 4 is more than capable of serving as a copilot, apprentice, collaborator, or partner. A student could easily have a conversation like mine, exploring the application of deep learning to real-world data. I believe it would be a good learning experience.
Epilogue - analyzing the data
After conducting the experiments and writing this document, I began to think that maybe the data was the problem. There are at least two possible connections between weather and influenza: (1) people spend more time indoors in bad weather and (2) some combinations of temperature and humidity reduce the virus’s ability to last on surfaces or travel in the air. Regarding (1) we don’t know how many bad weather days occurred in the week. Regarding (2) some weather sources include humidity but the data source I used only had it for some years so I excluded it.


So I decided to see what ChatGPT with the Python interpreter had to say. I simply uploaded the CSV file and entered “Please analyse” (no idea if being polite or using British spelling has any effect). The results were impressive.


In addition to all sorts of statistics, I saw the following and became concerned:
  

Though requesting “Can you graph TOTAL PATIENTS against the average of TMAX and TMIN” was somewhat reassuring:
  

It also produced these reasonable observations:
1. Seasonal Variation: There's a clear seasonal pattern in the average temperature, which is expected given the cyclical nature of seasons. The temperature rises during the summer months and drops during the winter.
2. Patient Count: The number of patients also exhibits some seasonal variation, though it's not as pronounced as the temperature. There are periods where patient counts are higher and others where they are lower.
3. Correlation: At a glance, there seems to be some correlation between the temperature and patient counts, especially in certain years. However, a more detailed correlation analysis would provide clearer insights.


It reported several correlations. Two that were interesting are:
1. TAVG (Average Temperature): 0.1695 (Slight positive correlation)
   * This indicates that there's a slight increase in the number of patients as the average temperature rises, though this correlation is not very strong.
2. TMIN (Minimum Temperature): -0.2693 (Moderate negative correlation)
   * There's a moderate decrease in the number of patients as the minimum temperature rises.


Not sure why they are opposite correlations. I then asked for “Correlations between TAVG and TOTAL PATIENTS over the following 6 weeks” since the weather should not have an immediate effect on influenza cases since it takes some time to develop sufficient symptoms to warrant going to a clinic. The result wasn’t what I expected:
* 1 Week Later: 0.1659 (Slight positive correlation)
* 2 Weeks Later: 0.1692 (Slight positive correlation)
* 3 Weeks Later: 0.1751 (Slight positive correlation)
* 4 Weeks Later: 0.1646 (Slight positive correlation)
* 5 Weeks Later: 0.1641 (Slight positive correlation)
* 6 Weeks Later: 0.1708 (Slight positive correlation)
Due to the missing TAVG data I then asked “What is [sic] the correlations between the average of TMAX and TMIN and the following six weeks of PATIENTS”. The results, while weak, did point to a decreasing correlation over time.
* 1 Week Later: -0.1810 (Slight negative correlation)
* 2 Weeks Later: -0.1668 (Slight negative correlation)
* 3 Weeks Later: -0.1312 (Slight negative correlation)
* 4 Weeks Later: -0.1329 (Slight negative correlation)
* 5 Weeks Later: -0.1131 (Slight negative correlation)
* 6 Weeks Later: -0.0873 (Slight negative correlation)
Asking “How about percipitation [sic] and six weeks of subsequent patient counts” produced weak results and this observation from ChatGPT “Across the 6-week period, there is a consistent slight negative correlation between precipitation and subsequent patient counts. This suggests that higher precipitation values are slightly associated with lower patient counts in the following weeks.”


I then worried that the way the patient numbers more than doubled and then generally remained almost double the earlier period led me to ask “When did the patient numbers shoot up and what may have been the cause?”. I did this in a new conversation.


  

ChatGPT explained “The sudden spike in patient numbers in 2020 is consistent with the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had significant impacts on healthcare systems worldwide, including in the state of Illinois.” When it offered to do more analysis I agreed and one of the conclusions it made was “In the context of the sharp increase in 2020, it's more likely that external factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, played a dominant role rather than weather conditions.” It is plausible that people were more likely to visit a clinic when they had influenza during the covid pandemic to determine if they have flu or covid. But oddly the data spikes September 2019 - not January 2020.
The lesson of the epilogue
I should have done this before preprocessing and training. Had I seen the data analysis I probably would have looked for other data. Or I would have tried to use only the 2010 to 2019 data. 


Following up on that thought I asked ChatGPT to truncate the data when the patient numbers shoot up. Also I asked it to update the relative patient numbers since it is computed from the average patient numbers for that week. The revised dataset is here. Its analysis of the new dataset was more promising:


PRCP (Precipitation): 
−0.072: A very weak negative correlation with the number of patients.


SNOW (Snowfall): 
0.319: A moderate positive correlation, suggesting that increased snowfall might be related to an increase in patients.


TAVG (Average Temperature): 
−0.276: A weak to moderate negative correlation, indicating that as average temperature decreases, the number of patients might increase.


TMAX (Maximum Temperature): 
−0.384: A moderate negative correlation, suggesting that colder maximum temperatures might lead to more patients.


TMIN (Minimum Temperature): 
−0.384: A moderate negative correlation similar to TMAX.


Much stronger correlations than previously. When I reran the final app using this data, the training and validation losses dropped by a factor of seven and my crude accuracy measure went from 37% to 76% (on some runs 81%). It seems the deep learning model was able to derive a strong signal from this portion of the data.


For a few hours, I thought the accuracy was 90%. I then noticed that the relative patient numbers were too low. By definition they should average 1. I found that when I asked ChatGPT “Can you replace the RATIO field with TOTAL PATIENTS divided by the average value for that week accross [sic] all the data?” It used the 2010-2023 data not the 2010-2019 to compute the averages. I redid the dataset by removing the 2020-2023 data and then requested “Can you replace the RATIO field with TOTAL PATIENTS divided by the average value for that week accross this new dataset?”. One must be careful what one asks for.


The dataset analysis, generation of the truncated dataset, and retesting the apps took approximately two hours.

The purpose of this exploration was not to generate a state-of-art professional model of influenza cases based upon weather data. I did find one such study: Long Short-term Memory–Based Prediction of the Spread of Influenza-Like Illness Leveraging Surveillance, Weather, and Twitter Data: Model Development and Validation and Predicting Flu-Rate Using Big Data Analytics Based on Social Data...: Ingenta Connect. The purpose of my study was to get some insight into the potential of chatbots to support students in applying machine learning to real-world questions. However, good researchers, even at the level of a high school student, should at some point read related work and absorb ideas and insights from such studies.


I have yet to do a close read of either of the closest studies similar to the one reported here. If I find time I’ll investigate why my model has a mean squared error of 0.023 while the other studies mention error rates of 0.07 or 0.67 and they include more than just weather data.
