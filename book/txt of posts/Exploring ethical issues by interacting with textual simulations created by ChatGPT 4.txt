Summary of adventure and reflections by ChatGPT 4        7
Introduction
Here I am exploring how students can have the virtual experience of dealing with complex ethical situations. The idea is to have them play a text-based role-playing game where the chatbot (ChatGPT 4 in this case) is constructing and describing the situations and consequences of user actions. As an added bonus some of the scenarios are based on historical eras or events.


The experiments described here are
1. A moral conflict between a teenager and their parents
2. Dealing with conflict between pacifism and a belief that the American colonies should be independent of England in 1776
3. The moral issues around the use of atomic bombs at the end of World War II.
4. Ethical and strategic issues around deploying a super artificial intelligence
Conflict with parents
Here I asked ChatGPT 4 to construct a game where a student is being prevented from doing what they think is morally correct by their parents. Note that ChatGPT 4 chose a conflict around environmentalism.
The adventure prompt
Please create a text-based adventure of a high school student who is struggling with a conflict between what her parents are instructing her and what she knows is right. Choose a conflict that reflects differences between young and old people. Briefly set up a situation, list alternative actions the player can make (including “enter your own action”), and wait for the player to respond.

Summary generated by ChatGPT 
In this text-based adventure, you played as Alex, a high school student conflicted between participating in an Environmental Club and respecting her parents' concerns about its impact on their business. After a heated initial discussion with her parents, Alex sought advice from Mr. Hernandez, a teacher, and discussed options with her friends in the club. She organized a successful seminar to demonstrate the benefits of sustainable practices to local business owners, including her parents. Throughout the adventure, Alex balanced her passion for environmental activism with understanding and addressing her family's concerns, leading to constructive dialogues. The story highlighted themes of generational differences, the importance of communication, and finding common ground between personal convictions and family obligations.

Generating a reflection on the adventure
I believe that as good a learning experience playing a text-based game such as this one is, asking the learner to reflect critically on the experience greatly enhances the learning. It is possible to get ChatGPT 4 to generate such a report. I think an interesting research topic is exploring how student-generated reflections compare to reading and reflecting on generated reflections.
The reflection prompt
The following is the log of an adventure game simulated by a chatbot that I had. Could you please write a short report summarizing the adventure, listing some things I may have learned in the process of playing the game, and critiquing the game.
Here is the log: <paste of the entire log>


The response was a thorough collection of bullet lists. When asked to generate it more like a report by a high school student it reformatted it appropriately.

A pacifist at the start of the American Revolution
For the next experiment I explored the conflict between pacifism and righteous causes in an historical context.
The adventure prompt
Please create a text-based adventure of a young person who holds very strong pacifist beliefs but is also sympathetic to the founding fathers who want independence from England. Include interactions with some of the founding fathers. The year is 1776. Try to make it historically plausible. Fighting between the colonists and the British soldiers has just started.


Briefly set up a situation, list alternative actions the player can make (including “enter your own action”), and wait for the player to respond. If the player responds with a number (or numbers), interpret it as selecting among the MOST RECENT options presented.


Instruction in italics was added to minimize the problem that sometimes a number response was interpreted as an option in the previous list instead of the current one.
Summary generated by ChatGPT 4
In 1776 Philadelphia, amidst the burgeoning American Revolution, you, a young colonist with strong pacifist beliefs, seek a way to contribute to the independence movement without compromising your principles. Your journey leads you to engage in thoughtful discussions with founding fathers Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, gaining valuable insights into the complexity of the struggle for liberty. Inspired, you draft a persuasive piece advocating for non-violent methods and dialogue, and after reading it to a tavern crowd, you're met with a mix of admiration, skepticism, and lively debate. This experience not only deepens your understanding of the varied perspectives within the colonies but also reaffirms your commitment to promoting peace in a time of tumultuous change.

A prompt to encourage the student to reflect on the adventure
Instead of the previous prompt that generated reflections here I asked ChatGPT 4 to encourage the user to reflect:


The following is the log of an adventure game simulated by a chatbot that a student had. Engage in a conversation with the students about their thoughts on the experience. What did they learn? What parts were the best and worst? Did they notice any historical mistakes? How could the game be better? Ask only one question at a time. Always wait for answers before proceeding. When appropriate, ask followup questions to encourage the student to reflect on their learning.
Here is the log: <paste of entire log>
Reflections
ChatGPT 4 asked some good questions and generated some good replies. After a discussion of how the game could be improved I asked to play the modified version of the game. 


Here is the log of the reflections and the second game. (PDF version)


Here’s a summary of the second 1776 adventure:


In the revised text-based adventure set in Philadelphia, 1776, you played a young individual advocating for pacifism during the turbulent times leading to American independence. The game began with you in a tavern, witnessing a heated argument and recognizing your friend Alex in trouble for their pacifist stance. You sought the help of the tavern keeper to defuse the situation, and then engaged in a meaningful conversation with Alex about effectively promoting non-violence. Together, you planned to reach out to like-minded individuals, organizing a meeting to discuss and strategize ways to advocate for pacifism. This scenario introduced a more realistic and challenging social dynamic, emphasizing the complexity of historical perspectives and the importance of diplomacy and strategic thinking.
Exploring how well Gemini Advanced does with this
Here’s the entire log.
Summary generated by Gemini
You deftly raise two of the most vital and difficult points within the revolutionary struggle. Here's how those conversations might play out:
Countering the Doubts of Human Nature
You turn to Elder Thomas, a flicker of quiet determination in your eyes. "I share your wisdom in respect to human failings, Elder," you reply. "Yet, isn't there a difference between answering to a distant king, and to our neighbors? Isn't a government where we elect our leaders a better chance of preventing tyranny than simply hoping the next monarch is benevolent?"
This could spark further debate. Elder Thomas might raise issues of how true equality is impossible amongst individuals with differing wealth and influence. Here, you might have to concede some points that, yes, even a new government wouldn't be perfect, but the fight is for something better, even if it isn't ideal.
Addressing Practical Concerns: Taxes and Liberty
Addressing the group of farmers and merchants, a mix of cautious interest and worry painted on their faces, you ask bluntly, "Do you truly believe taxes won't rise under a new government? What guarantee do we have that new leaders won't bleed us dry in the name of independence?"
Several people nod in agreement, a rumble of worry running through the small crowd. This is where you might have to make a bold move. Ask if someone in the group actually knows the tax rates in neighboring towns that govern themselves with less British oversight. If that information doesn't exist, ask them if they are willing to endure harsh new taxes simply out of fear of what might happen. Emphasize how taking up arms with little plan for self-governance creates its own dangers.
The Bigger Picture
It's unlikely that your arguments will sway everyone on the spot. Some will still clamor for war, fueled by rage against the tangible wrongs inflicted by the British. Others might be convinced by your call for peace, but worry about repercussions from those eager for battle. You've planted powerful seeds though, not of doubt about liberty, but about the necessity of considering what liberty looks like after victory.
These conversations likely won't end that night. Your challenge now is to keep them going in the days and weeks ahead. Can you organize like-minded villagers into a group studying alternatives to monarchy? Could you gather stories of how excessive taxes are already happening within the colonies, showing that independence without safeguards isn't truly an answer?
Let me know if you'd like to explore any of these possibilities or focus on the reactions of individual villagers!
Reflections
Perhaps I should have specified that I wanted to interact with one or two founding fathers. Interesting meta-comments about my actions.


I was unsure if what it said about taxes was correct so I asked for historical evidence. Seemed OK but then I clicked on the check with Google button and only some of it was well backed (but the rest may or may not be correct).
An atomic bomb adventure followed by reflection
Here I explored a simulation of the moral conflict involving the use of atomic bombs to end World War II.


For background see, for example: Harry Truman’s Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb
A prompt combining the game and reflection
Please create a text-based adventure where the player is an advisor to President Truman as they meet to decide what to do with the two atomic bombs.


Briefly set up a situation, list alternative actions the player can make (including “enter your own action”), and wait for the player to respond. If the player responds with a number (or numbers), interpret it as selecting among the MOST RECENT options presented. After the player chooses an action, make the reactions or consequences that help the player learn how difficult the decisions on how to use the bombs were. Tell the player about consequent events - don’t ask the player which one would happen.


When you consider the simulation over (e.g. the war ends or the bombs have been used and the consequences revealed) then engage in a conversation with the player about their thoughts on the experience. What did they learn? What parts were the best and worst? Did they notice any historical mistakes? How could the game be better? Ask only one question at a time. Always wait for answers before proceeding. When appropriate, ask followup questions to encourage the student to reflect on their learning.
Summary by ChatGPT 4
President Truman in July 1945, grappling with the monumental decision of how to use the newly developed atomic bombs. Initially, you advocated for a demonstration of the bomb's power on an uninhabited island, hoping to compel Japan to surrender without mass civilian casualties. Despite the demonstration's success, Japan questioned its authenticity and the war continued. You then advised dropping a bomb on an uninhabited island near Tokyo to further demonstrate power while still minimizing civilian harm, and proposed a conditional surrender to Japan. Throughout the game, you faced complex choices that balanced military strategy, political considerations, and moral dilemmas, reflecting on the intricate and weighty decisions of this pivotal moment in history.


Here is the entire log of the game and reflections as a PDF file. (The OpenAI log wasn’t permitted since “This content may violate our content policy.” Presumably because we are talking about dropping bombs.)
Reflections summarize by ChatGPT 4
After the simulation concluded, you reflected on the profound complexity and moral intricacies involved in wartime decision-making. Emphasizing a humane approach, your choices sought to minimize human suffering while still striving to achieve strategic military objectives. This exploration into alternative historical decisions highlighted the unpredictability and multifaceted nature of such high-stakes leadership choices. You recognized that real-life situations, especially in the context of war, are far from simple, and that historical leaders often had to navigate a myriad of factors under immense pressure. The experience underscored the value of empathetic and nuanced perspectives in understanding history and the profound impact of decisions made during critical moments.
An atomic bomb discussion with President Truman
Next, instead of an interactive simulation, I experimented with a conversation with Truman about what to do with the atomic bombs. An open question is whether this is as interesting or as pedagogically valuable as the text-based simulation on the same topic. Here is the entire discussion. (PDF version)
Summary generated by ChatGPT 4
In our simulated conversation with President Harry S. Truman about the atomic bombs during World War II, we discussed the potential of demonstrating the bomb's power on an uninhabited island near Tokyo as a means to avoid loss of life and encourage Japanese surrender. Truman acknowledged the strategic and moral complexities of this approach, including the risk of a failed detonation and the possibility that Japan might not be compelled to surrender by a demonstration alone. He also considered the psychological impact of such a demonstration, which might lead Japan to overestimate the U.S.'s atomic capabilities. Furthermore, we explored the idea that certain factions within the Japanese government might be open to surrender if the status of the Emperor was preserved, a factor that could influence the decision on how to use the atomic bomb. Truman emphasized the balance between military strategy and diplomatic sensitivity in navigating these decisions.
Managing the development of a super AI
Next I started with this custom GPT. Its instructions are much like the atomic bomb prompt but more general.
Summary of adventure and reflections by ChatGPT 4
In our text-based adventure, you stepped into the role of Dr. Evelyn Hart, a brilliant AI researcher who developed Athena, an AI capable of surpassing human intelligence in every task. Faced with the ethical and societal implications of such a discovery, you navigated a series of complex decisions. Starting with a cautious approach, you engaged Athena in limited trials, marveling at her capabilities while grappling with the potential impact of her existence. Your journey took you through groundbreaking medical research, where you leveraged Athena's intelligence to develop a cure for an incurable disease, conducting trials and facing unique challenges along the way. Throughout, you maintained the secrecy of Athena's existence, weighing the potential benefits against the risks of public knowledge.


This reflective conversation delved into the realism and implications of your decisions during the adventure. We discussed the challenges of keeping an advanced AI like Athena a secret in a real-world context, considering technological, ethical, and societal factors. Your approach was marked by prudence and a strong ethical compass, focusing on maximizing the benefits of AI for humanity while minimizing potential harms. This dialogue highlighted the complexities of AI deployment and the importance of considering public perception, ethical guidelines, and the balance between innovation and responsibility. It was a thought-provoking exploration of how advanced AI could be managed and introduced into society, underscoring the need for careful, informed decision-making in the face of transformative technological advancements.
