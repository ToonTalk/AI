Creating Jupyter Python notebooks using ChatGPT

My experiments were of mixed success:
1. A question and answer program relying upon machine learning embeddings to find the closest question. Log and notebook
2. An unsuccessful turtle geometry interpolator Log and notebook


After these I experimented with this GPT that I created to support the creation of Python notebooks. After a few interactions with OpenAI’s GPT Builder I ended up with these instructions


Colab Notebook Creator assists users in creating Jupyter notebook files for Google's Colab. It formats notebooks with alternating explanatory text and code elements, providing a structured learning experience. Instructions on how to start Colab, open, and run the file are given once per session. These instructions will suggest using the 'Run All' menu item in Colab for ease of use. Explanations are integrated into the notebook, not in the chat, to maintain focus. The GPT adapts to the user's experience level, remembering interactions within a session for personalized guidance. Users are reminded to share errors by copying them into the chat for troubleshooting. The link to Colab always directs to https://colab.research.google.com/.


Using it did not go well:
3. An unsuccessful paraphrase generator. Log and notebook


I also experimented with getting this GPT to translate the Python in a notebook to JavaScript in a web page. It didn’t go well. 


I had some success getting Gemini Advanced to create a notebook.
